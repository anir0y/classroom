dig more with `clean file system`

Args

### FLag 9
![](https://i.imgur.com/4uzm1Zo.png)

### FLag 10 
check the file create date of [Flag7](#flag-7)
![](https://i.imgur.com/qMrT8Zr.png)

### FLag 11
looking 10 min (before-after for any special logon)   
PS: use [Get-EventLog](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-eventlog?view=powershell-5.1) Date Range with XPath Filter

### FLag 12
GameOver is another Task Scheduled. opon investigation / running it like an Idiot you'll see the banner that tells you the Name of the tool. 
`mim.exe` 
![](https://i.imgur.com/lkb2Z1k.png)

### FLag-13
this machine doesnot have SYSMON, and took me 40 min to figure out where to look, long story short there is `google.com is hardcoded to 76.32.97.132` that's suspicious.

### FLag 14
Default web dir in Windows is `c:\inetpub\wwwroot` found the file `backddoors` there (jsp is the ans.)

![](https://i.imgur.com/qqFtsJj.png)

### FLag 15
Rookie `0x1337 Hax0r` mistake of using port `1337` 
PS: in Windows port can be open/close manually using Windosws built in firewall rules.   
![](https://i.imgur.com/AQvldFm.png)


### FLag 16
Ans is from [Flag-13](#flag-13), hardcoded known domain name.
