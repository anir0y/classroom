**Automobile** pentesting is the process of testing the security of connected vehicles and their components, such as electronic control units (ECUs), sensors, infotainment systems, etc. It involves identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities that could allow hackers to access, manipulate, or steal data from a vehicle or its passengers1.

As the automotive industry advances towards autonomous driving and more cars are connected to the internet, the need for vehicle cybersecurity becomes crucial. However, conducting security testing for automotive software requires specialized tools and skills that are not widely available2.

AutoHackOS is a new operating system that aims to provide a comprehensive solution for automobile pentesting. It is based on Linux and comes with a variety of pre-installed tools and frameworks that can be used to perform various types of attacks and analyses on vehicles and their networks.

Some of the features of AutoHackOS include:

CAN bus analysis and manipulation: AutoHackOS can monitor and send messages on the CAN bus, which is the main communication channel between different ECUs in a vehicle. It can also perform fuzzing, replay, and injection attacks to test the robustness and integrity of the CAN bus.
Wireless hacking: AutoHackOS can scan and exploit wireless protocols such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, GSM, etc. that are used by vehicles to communicate with external devices or networks. It can also perform jamming, spoofing, and hijacking attacks to disrupt or take over wireless connections.
Remote access: AutoHackOS can establish remote connections to vehicles via cellular networks, internet, or satellite. It can also use reverse shells or backdoors to gain persistent access and control over a vehicleâ€™s system.
Vulnerability scanning and exploitation: AutoHackOS can scan and identify vulnerabilities in vehicle software and firmware using various tools such as Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, etc. It can also exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code or commands on the target system.
Forensics and data extraction: AutoHackOS can analyze and recover data from vehicle memory, storage, or logs. It can also extract sensitive information such as GPS coordinates, personal details, passwords, etc. from vehicle databases or applications.
AutoHackOS is designed to be user-friendly and customizable. It has a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to easily navigate and launch different tools and modules. It also supports scripting and automation for more advanced users who want to create their own workflows or scenarios.

AutoHackOS is compatible with most common hardware devices and platforms that are used for automobile pentesting, such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, OBD-II dongles, etc. It can also be installed on a USB drive or a virtual machine for portability and convenience.

AutoHackOS is currently in beta testing and is available for download from its official website3. The developers of AutoHackOS welcome feedback and suggestions from the automotive security community and plan to add more features and improvements in the future.

AutoHackOS is a promising operating system that aims to make automobile pentesting easier and more accessible for security researchers, enthusiasts, and professionals. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and frameworks that can be used to test the security of connected vehicles and their components. By using AutoHackOS, users can discover and exploit vulnerabilities in vehicle software and hardware before hackers do.
