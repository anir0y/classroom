# Steganography - A list of useful tools and resources

Steganography
Steganography is hiding a file or a message inside of another file , there are many fun steganography CTF challenges out there where the flag is hidden in an image , audio file or even other types of files. Here is a list of the most tools I use and some other useful resources.

## Tools

### Steghide

Steghide is a steganography program that hides data in various kinds of image and audio files , only supports these file formats : JPEG, BMP, WAV and AU. but it’s also useful for extracting embedded and encrypted data from other files.
It can be installed with apt however the source can be found on github.

**Useful commands:** 

``` steghide info file ``` : displays info about a file whether it has embedded data or not.
```steghide extract -sf file ``` : extracts embedded data from a file
 
### Foremost

Foremost is a program that recovers files based on their headers , footers and internal data structures , I find it useful when dealing with png images.
It can be installed with ``` apt ``` however the source can be found on [github](https://github.com/korczis/foremost).

**Useful commands:** 

```foremost -i file ``` : extracts data from the given file

### Stegsolve

Sometimes there is a message or a text hidden in the image itself and in order to view it you need to apply some color filters or play with the color levels. You can do it with GIMP or Photoshop or any other image editing software but stegsolve made it easier. it’s a small java tool that applies many color filters on images. Personally i find it very useful
You can get it from [github](https://github.com/eugenekolo/sec-tools/tree/master/stego/stegsolve/stegsolve)

### Strings
Strings is a linux tool that displays printable strings in a file. That simple tool can be very helpful when solving stego challenges. Usually the embedded data is password protected or encrypted and sometimes the password is actaully in the file itself and can be easily viewed by using strings
It’s a default linux tool so you don’t need to install anything.

**Useful commands:** 

```strings file ```: displays printable strings in the given file.

### Exiftool
Sometimes important stuff is hidden in the metadata of the image or the file , exiftool can be very helpful to view the metadata of the files.
You can get it from [here](https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/)

```exiftool file ```: shows the metadata of the given file
```bash

### Exiv2
A tool similar to exiftool.
