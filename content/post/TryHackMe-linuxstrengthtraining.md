## Task 01:  Intro

This room is intended to further the understanding of basic Linux command line skills for beginners.

---

## Task 02: Finding your way around linux - overview

As a security researcher you will often be required to find specific files/folders on a system based on various conditions ranging from, but not limited to the following:

* size
* filename
* user/group
* date modified
* date accessed
* Its keyword contents

Therefore, we can do this using the following syntax:

|What we can do|Syntax|Real example of syntax
|---|---|---|
|Find files based on filename|find [directory path] -type f -name [filename]|find /home/Andy -type f -name sales.txt|
|Find Directory based on directory name|find [directory path] -type d -name [filename]|find /home/Andy -type d -name pictures|
|Find files based on size|find [directory path] -type f -size [size]|find /home/Andy -type f -size 10c <br> (c for bytes <br> k for kilobytes <br> M megabytes <br> G for gigabytes <br> type:'man find' for full information on the  options)|
|Find files based on username|find [directory path] -type f -user [username]|find /etc/server -type f -user john|
|Find files based on group name|find [directory path] -type f -group [group name]|find /etc/server -type f -group teamstar|
|Find files modified after a specific date|find [directory path] -type f -newermt '[date and time]'|find / -type f -newermt '6/30/2020 0:00:00' <br> (all dates/times after 6/30/2020 0:00:00 will be considered a condition to look for)|
|Find files based on date modified|find [directory path] -type f -newermt [start date range] ! -newermt [end date range]|find / -type f -newermt 2013-09-12 ! -newermt 2013-09-14 <br> (all dates before 2013-09-12 will be excluded; all dates after 2013-09-14 will be excluded, therefore this only leaves 2013-09-13 as the date to look for.)|
|Find files with a specific keyword|grep -iRl [directory path/keyword]|grep -iRl '/folderA/flag'|
|read the manual for the find command|man find|man find|

**Note**: There are many more useful commands aside from the examples above. If you ever have trouble understanding any of the syntax or getting it to work, head on over to [explainshell.com](explainshell.com) to check the syntax and see how this tool can help you on your journey to Linux greatness.

**Further notes**: if you do not know already, typing CTRL+L allows you to clear the screen quicker rather than typing 'clear' all the time. Additionally, hitting the up arrow allows you to return to a previously typed command so you do not have to spend time retyping it again if you made an error. Cool. Finally, placing: 2>/dev/null at the end of your find command can help filter your results to exclude files/directories that you do not have permission to.

### 2.2 What is the correct option for finding files based on group

`-group`

### 2.3 What is format for finding a file with the user named Francis and with a size of 52 kilobytes in the directory /home/francis/

`find /home/francis/ -type f -user Francis -size 52k`

### 2.4 SSH as topson using his password topson. Go to the /home/topson/chatlogs directory and type the following: grep -iRl 'keyword'. What is the name of the file that you found using this command?

`2019-10-11`

### 2.6 What are the characters subsequent to the word you found?

`ttitor`

![img](https://i.imgur.com/rRrGluz.png)

### 2.7 Read the file named 'ReadMeIfStuck.txt'. What is the Flag?

* read the 'ReadMeIfStuck.txt' file:

     ```cat
     topson@james:~$ cat ReadMeIfStuck.txt 
     Looking for flag 1?:It seems you will have to think harder if you want to find the flag. Perhaps try looking for a file called `additionalHINT` if you can't find it..
     Looking for flag 2?: look for a file named readME_hint.txt

     # stage 2
     topson@james:~$ find . -type f -name additionalHINT 
     ./channels/additionalHINT

     ## read the file
     topson@james:~$ cat ./channels/additionalHINT
     try to find a directory called telephone numbers... Oh wait.. it  contains a space.. I wonder how we can find that....


     # stage 3

     topson@james:~$ find . -type d -name 'telephone numbers' 
     ./corperateFiles/xch/telephone numbers

     topson@james:~$ ls -lhA './corperateFiles/xch/telephone numbers'
     total 4.0K
     -rw-r--r-- 1 topson topson 189 Oct  5 15:26 readME.txt

     topson@james:~$ cat './corperateFiles/xch/telephone numbers/readME.txt'
     202-555-0150
     202-555-0125
     617-555-0115
     +1-617-555-0115
     +1-617-555-0186
     +1-617-555-0138
     use the Find command to find a file with a modified date of 2016-09-12 from the /workflows directory

     topson@james:~$ find workflows/ -type f -newermt 2016-09-11 ! -newermt 2016-09-13

     workflows/xft/eBQRhHvx

     grep -oi '\S*flag\S*' workflows/xft/eBQRhHvx
     Flag{flag-was-here}
     ```

NOTE:

* \S is a regexp token to match any non-whitespace character
* -i to make case insensitive search
* -o to display only matching content

## Task 03: Working with files

You should be somewhat familiar already with working with files. Similar to windows, we can do the following:

* copy files and folders
* move files and folders
* rename files and folders
* create files and folders

For a quick recap to train your mental memory on the commands please refer to the below information:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/pTyp2w4.png)

A few additional things to remember is that occasionally you may encounter files/folders with special characters such as - (dash). Just remember that if you try to copy or move these files you will encounter errors because Linux interprets the - as a type of argument, therefore you will have to place -- just before the filename. For example: cp -- -filename.txt /home/folderExample.

### 3.1 Hypothetically, you find yourself in a directory with many files and want to move all these files to the directory of /home/francis/logs. What is the correct command to do this?

`mv * /home/francis/logs`

### 3.2 Hypothetically, you want to transfer a file from your /home/james/Desktop/ with the name script.py to the remote machine (192.168.10.5) directory of /home/john/scripts using the username of john. What would be the full command to do this?

`scp /home/james/Desktop/script.py john@192.168.10.5:/home/john/scripts`

### 3.3 How would you rename a folder named -logs to -newlogs

`mv -- -logs -newlogs`

### 3.4 How would you copy the file named encryption keys to the directory of /home/john/logs

`cp encryption keys /home/john/logs`

### 3.5 Find a file named readME_hint.txt inside topson's directory and read it. Using the instructions it gives you, get the second flag.

* let's read the 2nd flag

     ```bash
     # find `readME_hint.txt`
     topson@james:~$ find . -type f -name readME_hint.txt
     ./corperateFiles/RecordsFinances/readME_hint.txt

     #read the file
     topson@james:~$ cat ./corperateFiles/RecordsFinances/readME_hint.txt 
     Instructions: Move the MoveMe.txt file to the march folder directory and then execute the SH program to reveal the second flag.

     you need to research three things:
                                   how to execute bash files
                                   how to work with files that begin with a - (dash) whether that is to do with copying or moving files 
                                   how to work with files with spaces

     ### follow the instructions for flag2

     topson@james:~/corperateFiles/RecordsFinances$ mv -- -MoveMe.txt '-march folder'

     topson@james:~/corperateFiles/RecordsFinances$ cd -- '-march folder'

     topson@james:~/corperateFiles/RecordsFinances/-march folder$ bash -- -runME.sh
     -MoveMe.txt exists.
     Flag{flag-was-here}
     ```

     ```bash
     cat hash1.txt
     5d7845ac6ee7cfffafc5fe5f35cf666d
     #using online hash crackers
     plain text is: secret123
     ```

     Analyzing 'b7a875fc1ea228b9061041b7cec4bd3c52ab3ce3
     [ans-was-here]
     ```

### 4.5 Find a wordlist  with the file extention of '.mnf' and use it to crack the hash with the filename hashC.txt. What is the password?

* follow instructions

     ```bash
     find the wordlist

     ./system AB/db/ww.mnf

     #copy it to local machine
     scp sarah@[MACHINE_IP]:'~/system\ AB/db/ww.mnf' .

     # find the hashC.txt

     sarah@james:~$ find . -type f -name hashC.txt
     ./system AB/server_mail/hashC.txt

     # save the hash and get cracking

     ```

## Task 09: Final Challenge

### 9.1

### 9.2

What is Sameer's SSH password?

Hint: You may need to use grep to find keywords based on what you would expect the next chat log to include? Perhaps names?

* Find files including Sameer:

     ```bash
     sarah@james:~$ grep -iRl Sameer /home 2>/dev/null
     /home/shared/chatlogs/Pqmr
     /home/shared/chatlogs/LpnQ
     /home/shared/chatlogs/KfnP
     ```

* read the files: [here I'm sharing the releavent one]

     ```bash
     sarah@james:~$ cat /home/shared/chatlogs/Pqmr
     (2020-08-13) Sarah: Hey Sameer, do you by any chance no where I can find the sql back-up copy on this system? The database server is down, and I really need to help a customer out.

     (2020-08-13) Sameer: Sure. let me check.

     (2020-08-13) Sarah: Thanks.

     (2020-08-13) Sameer: check the home/shared/sql/ directory. It should be in there with the date of today.

     (2020-08-13) Sarah: Thank you Sameer.

     (2020-08-13) Sameer: No problem. It probably is encrypted. Just use the password: `danepon`.

     (2020-08-13) Sarah: OK, thank you.

     (2020-08-13) Sameer: No problem

     (2020-08-13) Sameer: By the way, if you have any issues just talk to Michael as I will be off for the remainder of the day. See you tomorrow. Bye.

     (2020-08-13) Sarah: Bye.
     ```

* SQL backup should be in /home/shared/sql/ and encrypted with the password `danepon`.

     ```bash
     sarah@james:~$ cat /home/shared/chatlogs/KfnP
     (2020-08-13) Sarah: Michael, I have been having trouble accessing the sql database back-up copy made today. Sameer gave me the password, but it just will not work?

     (2020-08-13) Michael: Ah, yes. I remember, the security engineer was testing out a new automated software for creating sql database backups. He must have configured it to encrypt the backups with a different password.

     (2020-08-13) Sarah: So how can I get a hold of it?

     (2020-08-13) Michael: Good question. From what I remember the test program utilised a configuration file around 50mb. It is located inside the home/shared/sql/conf directory. This configuration file contained the directory location of a wordlist it used to randomly select a password from for encrypting the sql back-up copies with.

     (2020-08-13) Sarah: I do not really understand the last part?

     (2020-08-13) Michael: once you find the configuration file and consequently the wordlist directory, visit it. One of those wordlists must contain the password it used for the testing. All I remember is that the password began with ebq. You will need Sameer’s account. His SSH password is: `thegreatestpasswordever000`.

     (2020-08-13) Sarah: Thank you, I will try to find it.
     ```

notes:

* password of /home/shared/sql/2020-08-13.zip.gpg is not danepon
* the config file is in /home/shared/sql/conf and is about 50mb
* the config file contains the wordlist directory
* the SQL backup password start with ebq
* Sameer's SSH password: thegreatestpasswordever000

### 9.3

What is the password for the sql database back-up copy

* Find the config file:

     ```bash
     sameer@james:~$ find /home/shared/sql/ -type f -size 50M
     /home/shared/sql/conf/JKpN

     sameer@james:~$ head /home/shared/sql/conf/JKpN

* wordlist dir:
  
     ```bash
     sameer@james:~$ printf %s aG9tZS9zYW1lZXIvSGlzdG9yeSBMQi9sYWJtaW5kL2xhdGVzdEJ1aWxkL2NvbmZpZ0JEQgo= | base64 -d
     home/sameer/History LB/labmind/latestBuild/configBD
     ```

There is a mistake here, the last folder is configBDB and not configBD.

* There 3 files with such passwords starting with ebq:

     ```bash
     sameer@james:~$ grep -iRlE '^ebq' '/home/sameer/History LB/labmind/latestBuild/configBDB'
     /home/sameer/History LB/labmind/latestBuild/configBDB/pLmjwi
     /home/sameer/History LB/labmind/latestBuild/configBDB/LmqAQl
     /home/sameer/History LB/labmind/latestBuild/configBDB/Ulpsmt
     ```

* Show only the passwords:

     ```bash
     sameer@james:~$ grep -iRhE '^ebq' '/home/sameer/History LB/labmind/latestBuild/configBDB'
     ebqiojsdfioj
     ebqiojsiodj
     ebqiojdifoj
     ebqiopsjdfopj
     ebqnice
     ebqops
     ebqiuiud
     ebqjoisjdfij
     ebqkjjdd
     ebqijsji
     ebqopkopk
     ebqattle
     ```

* Let's download the encrypted SQL backup:

     `$ scp sameer@10.10.61.194:/home/shared/sql/2020-08-13.zip.gpg .`

* `gpg2john` doesn't work because the file is too big:

     ```bash
     gpg2john 2020-08-13.zip.gpg 2020-08-13.zip.gpg.hash

     File 2020-08-13.zip.gpg
     Bad parameter: give(len=106935040, buf=0x5571785b0420, buf_size=90000), len can not be bigger than buf_size.
     ```

* So let's use [this script](https://gist.github.com/anir0y/3afcd6eaeeebe9f828515f33cf723b4c) instead:

     ```bash
     $ ./crackgpg.sh 2020-08-13.zip.gpg wordlist.txt
     FAILED - ebqiojsdfioj
     FAILED - ebqiojsiodj
     FAILED - ebqiojdifoj
     FAILED - ebqiopsjdfopj
     FAILED - ebqnice
     FAILED - ebqops
     FAILED - ebqiuiud
     FAILED - ebqjoisjdfij
     FAILED - ebqkjjdd
     FAILED - ebqijsji
     FAILED - ebqopkopk

     SUCESS - `ebqattle`  # flag 
     ```

### 9.4

     [sudo] password for james: 
     Matching Defaults entries for james on james:
     env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

     User james may run the following commands on james:
     (ALL : ALL) ALL
     ```

* Grab the flag:

     ```bash
     james@james:~$ sudo cat /root/root.txt
     Flag{flag-was-here}
