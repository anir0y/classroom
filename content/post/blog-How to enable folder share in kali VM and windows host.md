description: This comprehensive guide shows you how to seamlessly mount your Windows folder in a Kali Linux VM using VMware and open-vm-tools. Enhance your virtual machine experience with step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting tips.

## OverView

Installing "Guest Tools" significantly enhances the user experience with VMware virtual machines (VMs). As of September 2015, VMware recommends using the distribution-specific open-vm-tools (OVT) instead of the VMware Tools package for guest machines.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt update
[...]
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt install -y --reinstall open-vm-tools-desktop fuse
[...]
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ sudo reboot -f
kali@kali:~$
```
Adding Support for Shared Folders When Using OVT
Unfortunately, shared folders will not work out of the box, some additional scripts are needed. Those can be installed easily with kali-tweaks:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ kali-tweaks
```

In the Kali Tweaks menu, select Virtualization, then Install additional packages and scripts for VMware. Congratulations, you now have two additional tools in your toolbox!

The first one is a little script to mount the VMware Shared Folders. Invoke it with:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo mount-shared-folders
```

And with a bit of luck, check `/mnt/hgfs/` , and you should see your shared folders.
The second script is a helper to restart the VM tools. Indeed, it’s not uncommon for OVT to stops functioning correctly (e.g. such as copy/paste between the host OS and guest VM stops working). In this case, running this script can help to fix the issues:

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo restart-vm-tools
```

## Optional:  Editing ‘/etc/fstab’

Even though simply adding the folder to the VM is enough for the folder contents to be accessed through a VM in Virtual-box, we need to do some changes in the VMware VMs.

Open a terminal of your choice and go to /mnt/hgfs

```code
cd /mnt/hgfs
```
If you don't see anything in the folder, there’s a good chance that you will need to follow the below steps :D

If the folder is missing, why not just create it with :

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/hgfs
```

open and edit fstab with a editor of your choice. 

```bash
sudo vim /etc/fstab
```
enter the following at the end of the file, if you want this to work

```bash
vmhgfs-fuse /mnt/hgfs fuse defaults,allow_other 0 0
```

now save and reboot the vm 

```bash
reboot -f 
```

it should work, and you can file all your shared folders under `/mnt/hgfs` dir, if not run this command again 

```bash
sudo mount-shared-folders
```

## Changes you need to make on your VM settings:

1. In settings, goto tab `options`
2. click on **shared folders**
3. click on `add...` and locate your folder from explorer. 
4. ensure they're enabled, as you can see the tick mark.
