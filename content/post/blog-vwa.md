# Overview

VWA is a vulnerable web application focused on showcasing some most common attacks & apply fixes!

## why not DVWA ??

well the idea behind creating this lab was to making is easy to read code so it can be used for "Secure coding" labs as well as application security. DVWA is a amazing start point where you can set and see different levels of vulnerability and the secure code practice.

this one is a isolated lab to focus on one thing at a time!

## I don't know the login details :(

don't worry you can use sql injection to bypass the login or you can create a new user (`a little enum is required!`)

## where I can find the code?

**here is the github link**:  [https://github.com/anir0y/vwa](https://github.com/anir0y/vwa)
