## OverView

Subnetting is a fundamental concept in networking that involves dividing a larger network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks, or subnets. This practice enhances network performance, improves security, and simplifies management. In this blog post, we'll explore the basics of subnetting, its importance, and provide practical examples to illustrate how it works.

**What is Subnetting?**

Subnetting is the process of splitting an IP address space into multiple smaller segments called subnets. Each subnet functions as an independent network, allowing for better organization and management of IP addresses. This division is achieved by manipulating the subnet mask, which determines the network and host portions of an IP address.

**Why is Subnetting Important?**

1. **Efficient IP Address Management:** Subnetting allows organizations to allocate IP addresses more efficiently, reducing waste and ensuring that address space is utilized effectively.

2. **Improved Network Performance:** By dividing a large network into smaller subnets, broadcast traffic is contained within each subnet, reducing overall network congestion and improving performance.

3. **Enhanced Security:** Subnets can be used to isolate different segments of a network, limiting the spread of potential security threats and allowing for the implementation of specific security policies for each subnet.

4. **Simplified Troubleshooting:** Smaller, segmented networks make it easier to identify and resolve network issues, as the scope of troubleshooting is limited to individual subnets.

**Understanding Subnet Masks**

A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that separates the network portion of an IP address from the host portion. It consists of consecutive '1' bits followed by '0' bits. The '1' bits represent the network part, while the '0' bits represent the host part.

For example, in the IP address 192.168.1.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0:

- **Binary Representation:**
  - IP Address: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
  - Subnet Mask: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

The first 24 bits (the '1's in the subnet mask) represent the network portion, and the remaining 8 bits (the '0's) represent the host portion.

**Calculating Subnets**

To determine the number of subnets and hosts per subnet, you can use the following formulas:

- **Number of Subnets:** 2^n
- **Number of Hosts per Subnet:** (2^h) - 2

Where:
- 'n' is the number of bits borrowed for subnetting (the number of '1's added to the default subnet mask).
- 'h' is the number of bits remaining for hosts (the number of '0's in the subnet mask).

**Practical Example**

Let's say we have a Class C IP address: 192.168.1.0, and we want to create 4 subnets.

1. **Determine the Number of Bits to Borrow:**
   - We need at least 2 bits to create 4 subnets (2^2 = 4).

2. **Calculate the New Subnet Mask:**
   - The default subnet mask for a Class C address is 255.255.255.0.
   - Borrowing 2 bits changes the subnet mask to 255.255.255.192 (11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000 in binary).

3. **Calculate the Number of Hosts per Subnet:**
   - With 6 bits remaining for hosts (8 original bits - 2 borrowed bits), each subnet can have (2^6) - 2 = 62 hosts.

4. **Identify the Subnets:**
   - The subnets are identified by incrementing the subnet bits:
     - 192.168.1.0/26
     - 192.168.1.64/26
     - 192.168.1.128/26
     - 192.168.1.192/26

Each of these subnets can accommodate up to 62 hosts.

**Conclusion**

Subnetting is a powerful tool in network design and management, offering benefits in IP address utilization, performance optimization, security enhancement, and troubleshooting efficiency. By understanding and applying subnetting principles, network administrators can create scalable and efficient network infrastructures.

### Practical

**Exploring the Network Repository**

The repository contains various files and directories that provide hands-on exercises related to networking concepts. While the specific details of each file are not fully visible in the provided information, we can infer the following based on typical repository structures:

- **`.github/workflows/` Directory:** This directory usually contains workflow files for continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

- **`.gitignore` File:** Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git, preventing them from being tracked in version control.

- **`README.md` File:** Typically provides an overview of the repository, instructions, and documentation.

- **`go.mod` and `go.sum` Files:** Indicate that the project is written in Go and these files manage dependencies.

- **`index.html` File:** Suggests the presence of a web-based interface or documentation.

- **`main.go` File:** Likely contains the main application code written in Go.

**Practical Application: Subnetting Exercises**

While the exact content of the repository is not fully detailed, a typical subnetting exercise in such a repository might involve the following steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anir0y/network.git
   cd network
   ```

2. **Review the README:**
   Open the `README.md` file to understand the project's objectives, prerequisites, and instructions.

3. **Set Up the Environment:**
   Ensure you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed. For a Go project, this typically involves installing Go and running:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

4. **Explore the Code:**
   Examine the `main.go` file to understand how the application handles subnetting calculations. Look for functions or methods that perform IP address manipulations, subnet mask calculations, and network segmentation.

5. **Run the Application:**
   Execute the application to see subnetting in action. This might involve running:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
   Observe the output to understand how the application processes input and displays subnetting information.

6. **Modify and Experiment:**
   Try modifying the code to handle different IP address ranges or subnet masks. Experiment with various scenarios to see how the application responds and to deepen your understanding of subnetting concepts.

**Conclusion**

Engaging with practical exercises, such as those potentially provided in the [network repository by anir0y](https://github.com/anir0y/network/), allows you to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios.
