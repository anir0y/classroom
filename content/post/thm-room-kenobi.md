## Task 04:  Privilege Escalation with Path Variable Manipulation

![suid](https://i.imgur.com/LN2uOCJ.png)

 

|Flag-ID|question|
|:--|---|
|1|What file looks particularly out of the ordinary?|
||`/usr/bin/menu`|
|2|Run the binary, how many options appear?|
||`3`|
|3|We copied the /bin/sh shell, called it curl, gave it the correct permissions and then put its location in our path. This meant that when the /usr/bin/menu binary was run, its using our path variable to find the "curl" binary.. Which is actually a version of /usr/sh, as well as this file being run as root it runs our shell as root!|
||`n\a`|
|4|What is the root flag (/root/root.txt)?|
