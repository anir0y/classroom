## task 01: Introduction

It's incredible how often our computers are in the scope of cyber attacks. Antivirus has become an indispensable shield to provide us with a more secure environment, since we are exposed to destructible malware and cyber attacks. Inside our pockets, we have computers so powerful, but much smaller, we must be equally attentive on our phones, because we can suffer equally damaging attacks, sometimes even worse, because they can store relevant information such as private conversations and important accounts.

## task 03: Small size, a lot of destruction.

### 3.1

     Deploy the machine & use MobSF to scan the file named "TWFsd2FyZQ.apk" that is located on the Desktop.

### 3.2

What is the format of the file?

     `apk`

### 3.3

The sample's size is 10,1 bytes, so it seems that it is not a complex application.

### 3.4

Decode the name of the sample.

`[System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String("{file.apk}=="))` # '==' is for padding.

## task 04: Digging Deeper

Let's make a deeper analysis.

VirusTotal is a incredible service, this web site can give us the power of analyze a package with the database of more then seventy Anti-Virus, and the result is fast and accurate.

https://www.virustotal.com/

To analyze the file in VirusTotal, you will need the file hash, you can get it by using the powershell cmdlet "Get-FileHash" or you can analyze the filw with MobSF and it will show the file hash (we will get back to this tool in the next task)

### 4.1

What does Avast-Mobile can tell us about this software?

* get the Hash
  
  ![img](https://i.imgur.com/wt77bJf.png)

* find on VT

     ![img](https://i.imgur.com/qith0hT.png)

### 4.2

What program was used to create the malware?

* a little research reveals this is done with `msf`

### 4.3

The results provided by VirusTotal shows that we have a generic malware. It does not serve for attack purposes because we can see that a good part of the Antiviruses are detecting it, this malware is a good one for searching purposes, but it is also used for post exploitation.

### 4.4

What is the package name?

* read the [Details](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e201a1d2cecf1d04d97d59abec0863c716dcf9fcad89b85d036f9163a48057e7/details)

### 4.5

What is the SHA-1 signature?

* read the [Details](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e201a1d2cecf1d04d97d59abec0863c716dcf9fcad89b85d036f9163a48057e7/details)

### 4.6

By extracting the content, it will create a folder with some files inside, one of which is a XML. It describes some important information about the application for Android build tools, for Android operating system and for Google Play. This file declares items, shows some stuff as the package name and the permissions required to the device. The information that will be needed for the next questions can be found on VirusTotal also.

### 4.7

What is the unique XML file?

* read this page on [VirulTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e201a1d2cecf1d04d97d59abec0863c716dcf9fcad89b85d036f9163a48057e7/relations)

### 4.8

How many permissions are there inside?

* read the [Details](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e201a1d2cecf1d04d97d59abec0863c716dcf9fcad89b85d036f9163a48057e7/details)
