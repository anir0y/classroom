   After receiving feedback, it appeared spammy. Additionally, there have been two blog posts addressing their suspicious activities:
   - [Blog Hax0r Stories 001](https://classroom.anir0y.in/post/blog-hax0r-stories-001/)
   - [Blog Addressing Alligation](https://classroom.anir0y.in/post/blog-addressing-alligation/)

Today (May 11, 2024), I received similar feedback on Twitter from user @riendut0uttt:

[Link to tweet](https://twitter.com/riendut0uttt/status/1788889161535017189)

Based on this feedback, I revisited the links and discovered that some of them are indeed malicious, according to various online sources. Therefore, this post will remain closed until I implement a more robust method for automating and validating dark links.

For further insights, Twitter user [@ZachXBT](https://twitter.com/zachxbt) has provided a detailed review:
[Anir0y Scams Info](https://anir0y-scams.info/)

Though [@ZachXBT](https://twitter.com/zachxbt) may lack proficiency in OSINT, considering his prior work and perceptions of Indian scammers, I can understand his perspective.

I want to clarify once more that all links were gathered from multiple sources at the time of posting, and not all were validated. Moving forward, I am committed to improving the validation process for dark links.
