&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you import a GPG key, you are trusting that the key belongs to the person or organization who claims to own it. There are a few ways to trust imported GPG keys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web of trust: The web of trust is a decentralized system for verifying GPG keys. When you import a key, you can choose to trust it based on the trust of other people in the web of trust.
Keyserver: A keyserver is a server that stores GPG keys. When you import a key, you can choose to trust it based on the trust of the keyserver.
Manually: You can also manually trust a GPG key by adding it to your keyring with the gpg &amp;ndash;edit-key command.
Once you have trusted an imported GPG key, you can use it to encrypt and sign data.&lt;/p&gt;</description><enclosure url="https://classroom.anir0y.in/img/gpg.png"/><link>https://classroom.anir0y.in/post/blog-how-to-trust-imported-gpg-keys/</link></item><item><title>Notes Gnupg</title><pubDate>Tue, 13 Apr 2021 16:57:30 +0530</pubDate><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://classroom.anir0y.in" width="700" height="420"/><description>&lt;h1 id="how-to-use-gpg-to-encrypt-and-sign-messages"&gt;How To Use GPG to Encrypt and Sign Messages&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPG, or GNU Privacy Guard, is a public key cryptography implementation. This allows for the secure transmission of information between parties and can be used to verify that the origin of a message is genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this guide, we will discuss how GPG works and how to implement it. We will be using an Ubuntu 16.04 server for this demonstration, but will include instructions for other distributions as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description><enclosure url="https://classroom.anir0y.in"/><link>https://classroom.anir0y.in/post/notes-gnupg/</link></item></channel></rss>
