Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) are both security services that focus on identifying vulnerabilities in the network, server and system infrastructure. Both the services serves a different purpose and are carried out to achieve different but complimentary goals.
Vulnerability Assessment focuses on internal organizational security, while Penetration Testing focuses on external real-world risk.
What is Vulnerability Assessment (VA)? A Vulnerability Assessment is a rapid automated review of network devices, servers and systems to identify key vulnerabilities and configuration issues that an attacker may be able to take advantage off.</description></item><item><title>Volatility Installation in Linux</title><link>https://classroom.anir0y.in/post/vol2-installation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Mar 2021 01:00:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://classroom.anir0y.in/post/vol2-installation/</guid><description>How to Install Volatility 2.6 in Kali Volatility is no longer packaged with new Kali releases, but can be manually installed.
