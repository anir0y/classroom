Use your knowledge to investigate an employee who is being accused of leaking private company data.\nProfile Support Task 01: Introduction What is Autopsy?\nThe official description: “Autopsy is the premier open source forensics platform which is fast, easy-to-use, and capable of analyzing all types of mobile devices and digital media. Its plug-in architecture enables extensibility from community-developed or custom-built modules. Autopsy evolves to meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of professionals in law enforcement, national security, litigation support, and corporate investigation.”\nAutopsy is a powerful tool. Several features within Autopsy were developed thanks to the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology funding. You can read more about this here.\nFlags 1.1 NA na Task 02: Installation Installing Autopsy for Windows is pretty straightforward.\nVisit the Autopsy download page and download the Windows MSI, which corresponds to your Windows architecture, 32bit or 64bit.\nRun the Autopsy MSI file If Windows prompts with User Account Control, click Yes Click through the dialog boxes until you click a button that says Finish Autopsy is also available for Linux and macOS. Follow the install instructions provided on the Autopsy website.\nIf you use Kali Linux, Autopsy is already installed. Task 03: Workflow Overview Before diving into Autopsy and analyzing data, there are a few steps to perform, such as identifying the data source and what Autopsy actions to perform with the data source.\nYour basic workflow:\nCreate the case for the data source you will investigate Select the data source you wish to analyze Configure the ingest modules to extract specific artifacts from the data source Review the artifacts extracted by the ingest modules Create the report Below is a visual of step #1.\nWhen you start Autopsy, there will be 3 options. To start a new case, click on New Case\nThe next screen is titled Case Information, and this is where information about the case is populated.\nCase Name: The name you wish to give to the case Base Directory: The root directory that will store all the files specific to the case (the full path will be displayed) Case Type: Specify whether this case will be local (Single-user) or hosted on a server where multiple analysts can review (Multi-user) Note: In this room, the focus is on Single-User.\nThe screen that follows is titled, Optional Information and it can be left blank for our purposes. In an actual forensic environment, you should fill out this information. When you’re done, click Finish.\nIn this room, you will import a case. To open a case, you will select is Open Case.\nAutopsy case files have an .aut file extension. Navigate to the case folder and select the .aut file you wish to open.\nNext, Autopsy will process the case files open the case.\nYou can identify the name of the case at the top left corner of the Autopsy window. In the image below, the name of this case is Tryhackme\nNote: If Autopsy is unable to locate the disk image, a warning box will appear. At this point, you can point Autopsy to the location of the disk image it’s attempting to find, or you can click NO; you can still analyze the data from the Autopsy case.\nOnce the case you wish to analyze is open, you are ready to start analyzing the data.\nFlags 3.1 Autopsy files end with which file extension? .aut Task 04: Data Sources Before diving into analyzing the data, let’s briefly cover the different data sources Autopsy can analyze.\nBelow is a screenshot of the Add Data Source Windows dialog box. In this room, we will focus primarily on the first option, Disk Image or VM file\nSupported Disk Image Formats:\nRaw Single (For example: *.img, *.dd, *.raw, *.bin) Raw Split (For example: *.001, *.002, *.aa, *.ab, etc) EnCase (For example: *.e01, *.e02, etc) Virtual Machines (For example: *.vmdk, *.vhd) If there are multiple image files (e.i. E01, E02, E03, etc.) Autopsy only needs you to point to the first image file, and Autopsy will handle the rest.\nNote: Refer to the Autopsy documentation to understand the other data sources that can be added to a case.\nBelow is a screenshot of an E01 disk image added to a sample case as a data source.\nSpecify the time zone and click Next.\nNote: Orphan files are deleted files that no longer have a parent folder. In FAT file systems, it can be time-sensitive to read and analyze.\nFlags-4.1 In the above screenshot, what is the disk image format for SUSPECTHD? EnCase Explantion-4.1 File name ends with .E01 that’s a extention of EnCase.\nTask 05: Ingest Modules Essentially Ingest Modules are Autopsy plug-ins. Each Ingest Module is designed to analyze and retrieve specific data from the drive.\nBelow is a screenshot of the Configure Ingest Modules window.\nBy default, the Ingest Modules are configured to run on All Files, Directories, and Unallocated Space.\nThe other two options are:\nAll Files and Directories (Not Unallocated Space) Create/edit file ingest filters “Note: not covered ingest filters in this room”.\nIf all the Ingest Modules are deselected, and Next is selected, Autopsy will still process the data source and update the local database\nNote: Autopsy adds metadata about files to the local database, not the actual file contents.\nWhen Autopsy is done, you will see the following:\nTo complete this process, click Finish.\nIn the below image, since the Ingest Modules were deselected, there aren’t any results in the Results node.\nThe results of any Ingest Module you select to run against a data source will populate the Results node in the Tree view, which is the left pane of the Autopsy user interface.\nYou can run Ingest Modules at any time while the case is open. To do so, right-click on the data source and select Run Ingest Modules.\nAs Ingest Modules run, alerts may appear in the Ingest Inbox.\nBelow is an example of the Ingest Inbox after a few Ingest Modules have completed running.\nDrawing the attention back to the Configure Ingest Modules window, notice that some Ingest Modules have per-run settings and some do not.\nFor example, the Recent Activity Ingest Module does not have per-run settings. In contrast, the Hash Lookup Ingest Module does.\nTo learn more about Ingest Modules, read Autopsy documentation here.\nFlags 5.1 No flags\nTask 06: The User Interface Let’s look at the Autopsy user interface, which is comprised of 5 primary areas:\nTree Viewer (Left pane) Result Viewer (Top right pane) Keyword Search (Upper Top Right) Contents Viewer (Bottom right pane) Status Area (Lower Bottom right) Each area will be explained briefly below.\nTree Viewer The Tree Viewer has 5 top-level nodes:\nData Sources - all the data will be organized as you would typically see it in a normal Windows File Explorer. Views - files will be organized based on file types, MIME types, file size, etc. Results - as mentioned earlier, this is where the results from Ingest Modules will appear. Tags - will display files and/or results that have been tagged (read more about tagging here) Reports - will display reports either generated by modules or the analyst. (read more about reporting here) Refer to the Autopsy documentation on the Tree Viewer for more information here.\nResult Viewer Note: Don’t confuse the Results node (from the Tree Viewer) with the Result Viewer.\nWhen a volume, file, folder, etc., are selected from the Tree Viewer, additional information about the selected item is displayed in the Result Viewer.\nFor example, the Sample case’s data source is selected, and now additional information is visible in the Results Viewer.\nIf a volume is selected, the Result Viewer’s information will change to reflect the information in the local database for the selected volume.\nNotice that the Result Viewer pane has 3 tabs: Table, Thumbnail, and Summary. The 2 above screenshots reflect the information displayed in the Table tab.\nThe Thumbnail tab works best with image or video files. If the view of the above data is changed from Table to Thumbnail, not much information will be displayed. See below.\nVolume nodes can be expanded, and an analyst can navigate the volume’s contents, as they would a typical Windows system.\nIn the Views tree node, files are categorized by File Types - By Extension, By MIME Type, Deleted Files, and By File Size.\nTip: When it comes to File Types, pay attention to this section. An adversary can rename a file with a misleading file extension. So the file will be ‘miscategorized’ By Extension but will be categorized appropriately by MIME Type.\nExpand By Extension and more children nodes appear, categorizing files even further (see below).\nRefer to the Autopsy documentation on the Result Viewer for more information here.\nContents Viewer From the Table tab in the Result Viewer, if you click any folder/file, additional information is displayed in the Contents Viewer pane.\nIn the above image, 3 columns might not be quickly understood what they represent.\nS = Score The Score will show a red exclamation point for a folder/file marked/tagged as notable and a yellow triangle pointing downward for a folder/file that is marked/tagged as suspicious. These items can be marked/tagged by an Ingest Module or by the analyst.\nC = Comment If a yellow page is visible in the Comment column, it will indicate that there is a comment for the folder/file.\nO = Occurrence In a nutshell, this column will indicate how many times this file/folder has been seen in past cases (this will require the Central Repository)\nRefer to the Autopsy documentation on the Contents Viewer for more information here.\nKeyword Search At the top right, you will find Keyword Lists and Keyword Search.\nWith Keyword Search, an analyst can perform an AD-HOC keyword search.\nIn the image above, the analyst is searching for the word ‘secret.’ Below are the search results.\nRefer to the Autopsy documentation for more information on how to perform keyword searches with either option.\nStatus Area Lastly, the Status Area is at the bottom right.\nWhen Ingest Modules are running, a progress bar (along with the percentage completed) will be displayed in this area. If you click on the bar, more detailed information regarding the Ingest Modules is provided.\nIf the X (directly next to the progress bar) is clicked on, a prompt will appear confirming if you wish to end cancel the Ingest Modules.\nRefer to the Autopsy documentation on the UI overview here.\nTask 07: Data Analysis Case Scenario: An employee was suspected of leaking company data. A disk image was retrieved from the machine. You were assigned to perform the initial analysis. Further action will be determined based on the initial findings.\nReminder: Since the actual disk image is not in the attached VM, certain Autopsy sections will not display any actual data, only the metadata for that row within the local database. You can click No when you’re notified about the ‘Missing Image.’ Additionally, you do not need to run any ingest modules in this exercise. Flags-7 Flag ID Question ANS 1 What is the full name of the operating system version? windows 7 ultimate service pack 1 2 What percentage of the drive are documents? Include the % in your answer. 40.8% 3 The majority of file events occurred on what date? (MONTH DD, YYYY) ans 4 What is the name of an Installed Program with the version number of 6.2.0.2962? ans 5 Question ans 6 Question ans 7 Question ans 8 Question ans 9 Question ans 10 Question ans Flag-7.1 Flag-7.2 Click on Disk -\u003e Listing -\u003e Summery\nFlag-7.3 Summery tab has the answers\nFlag-7.4 Flag-7.5 Flag-7.6 Flag-7.7 Took me 20 min to figure out, lastly I used the hacky way by looking for search results manually and eye balling. not sure if that was intended way.\nFlag-7.8 TimeStamp was helpful\nFlag-7.9 Flag-7.10 Task 08: Visualization Tools Please refer to the Autopsy documentation for the following visualization tool:\nImages/Videos - http://sleuthkit.org/autopsy/docs/user-docs/4.12.0/image_gallery_page.html Communications - http://sleuthkit.org/autopsy/docs/user-docs/4.12.0/communications_page.html Timeline - http://sleuthkit.org/autopsy/docs/user-docs/4.12.0/timeline_page.html Note: Within the attached VM, you will NOT be able to practice with some of the visualization tools, except for Timeline.\nBelow is a screenshot of the Timeline.\nThe Timeline tool is composed of 3 areas:\nFilters - narrow the events displayed based on the filter criteria Events - the events are displayed here based on the View Mode Files/Contents - additional information on the event(s) is displayed in this area There are 3 view modes:\nCounts - the number of events is displayed in a bar chart view Details - information on events is displayed, but they are clustered and collapsed, so the UI is not overloaded List - the events are displayed in a table view In the above screenshot, the View Mode is Counts. Below is a screenshot of the Details View Mode.\nThe numbers (seen above) indicate the number of clustered/collapsed events for a specific time frame.\nFor example, for /Windows, there are 130,257 events between 2009-06-10 and 2010-03-18. See the below image.\nTo expand a cluster, click on the green icon with the plus sign. See the below example.\nTo collapse the events, click on the red icon with a minus sign. Click the map marker icon with a plus sign if you wish to pin a group of events. This will move (pin) the events to an isolated section of the Events view.\nTo unpin the events, click on the map marker with the minus sign.\nThe last group of icons to cover are the eye icons. If you wish to hide a group of events from the Events view, click on the eye with a minus sign.\nIn the below screenshot, the clustered events for /Boot were hidden and were placed in Hidden Descriptions (in the Filters area).\nIf you wish to reverse that action and unhide the events, right-click and select Unhide and remove from list. See the below example.\nLast but not least, below is a screenshot of the List View Mode.\nThis should be enough information to get you started interacting with the Timeline with some level of confidence.\nFlag8-1 Using the Timeline, how many results were there on 2015-01-12? 46 Task 9: Conclusion To conclude, there is more to Autopsy that wasn’t covered in detail within this room.\nBelow are some topics that you should explore on your own to configure Autopsy to do more out of the box:\nGlobal Hash Lookup Settings Global File Extension Mismatch Identification Settings Global Keyword Search Settings Global Interesting Items Settings Yara Analyzer 3rd Party modules are available for Autopsy. Visit the official SleuthKit GitHub repo for a list of 3rd party modules here.\nThe disk image used with this room’s development was created and released by the NIST under the Computer Forensic Reference Data Sets (CFReDS) Project. It is encouraged to download the disk image, go through the full exercise (here) to practice using Autopsy, and level up your investigation techniques.\n","wordCount":"2505","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://classroom.anir0y.in/img/thm.gif","datePublished":"2021-05-27T00:31:13+05:30","dateModified":"2021-05-27T00:31:13+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Animesh Roy"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://classroom.anir0y.in/post/thm-room-btautopsye0/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Classroom","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://classroom.anir0y.in/img/avatar.jpeg"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://classroom.anir0y.in/ accesskey=h title="Classroom (Alt + H)"><img src=https://classroom.anir0y.in/img/avatar.jpeg alt aria-label=logo height=35>Classroom</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
