In this lesson, we are going to learn about one of the best ones ever made: Django.\nDjango is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It allows you to develop websites and web applications in a matter of hours.\nDjango can automatically compile HTML code, therefore making it possible for anyone without any advanced knowledge in markup languages to develop a website. Additionally, Django is arguably one of the most secure developing frameworks, which in the right configuration, can strongly resist against SQL injections and XSS.\nAll in all, if you are familiar with Python and considering creating a website, Django can be a really good choice. As for penetration tester, it is important to understand the basic structure of Django-powered websites in order to be able to identify possible weaknesses and mistakes a developer can make.\n02: Getting started For this room, we are going to use Python 3. (Any 3.x.x works here) with Django 2.2\nInstall Django by running this command:\npip3 install Django==2.2.12\nNow we are ready to create and properly configure our first website.\nMake a directory for your project files and navigate there with the command prompt.\nrun django-admin startproject {project_name} in order to start your project. (Replace {project_name} with your prefered name).\nRun python3 manage.py migrate to automatically configure new files.\nAfter creating the project you can see that Django creates a file manage.py and a file directory named after your project.\nmanage.py is a command-line utility that lets you interact with your Django project in various ways. It is especially handy in creating web-apps, managing databases, and most importantly running the server.\nBasic syntax for using this utility is python3 manage.py {command}\n\u003erunserver\nRunserver is the most important command used with manage.py; It allows you to deploy your website on the server. Django has a wonderful feature that allows you to instantly see changes made on the website without restarting it. (It is only necessary to restart runserver command when adding a new app).\nRun this command and navigate to your website with IP given in the outline. You should see a page like this:\nNote: If you are willing to run the server to your local network, just add 0.0.0.0:8000 after runserver command. (In case if you get an error afterward, just go to settings.py located your websites folder and add this address to ALLOWED_HOSTS)\n\u003e createsuperuser\nThis command allows you to create an admin account for your Django web admin panel.\nRun this command and access the panel at IP:8000/admin\n\u003e startapp\nStartapp allows you to initialize an app for your project. Django projects can have infinite number of apps. Basic syntax:\npython3 manage.py startapp {app_name}\n02-Flags Answer the questions below ans How would we create an app called Forms? python3 manage.py startapp Forms How would we run our project to a local network? python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 03: Creating a website Now, let’s go ahead and create a very simple app:\nCreate an app using a command from Unit 2 and call it whatever you like. I will be using ‘Articles’ for this lesson.\nHead over to settings.py and include your app name in INSTALLED_APPS:\nHead over to urls.py (located in the main folder!) and include a path to your app there: Note that {app_name} should be replaced with your app’s name.\nMigrate your changes by running python3 manage.py migrate Your app is now located in the https://IP:8000/{app_name}\nAfter successful app creation let’s move over to the app directory and proceed there. As seen, Django automatically creates files inside your app folder. We are going to go through their purposes as we continue creating our website.\nFor now, create a file urls.py which will be especially handy in the closest future.\nGenerally speaking, Django-driven websites operate in this way:\nurls.py is responsible for accepting and redistributing incoming HTTP requests via views.py\nBasic syntax for urls.py can be seen on the screenshot above.\nWe create a variable called urlpatterns in which we state names of our directories. views.index calls index function from views.py to be executed therefore creating some output response for HTTP request.\nFor example, if we are willing to create a directory called “archive”, with function “main”, we would include this in urls.py:\npath('archive/', views.main, name ='main')\nNOTE: Paths with blank directory (’’) are going to call the function whenever the app is accessed at https://IP/{app_name}; any other directories are going to extend the link, for example, the archives directory I used above would be located in https://IP/articles/archive.\nviews.py is responsible for carrying out functions which are called using urls.py\nNow let’s create a simple HTTP response function for our app.\nThe syntax is pretty easy for this one. All you have to do is create a function with a certain name which you will be referring to in urls.py\nHere’s an example of a function that returns “Hello, world!” message:\nNote that in this case the function is called index, and so in order to make it work you need to put this line into your urls.py\npath('', views.index, name='index'),\nNow navigate to your http://IP:8000/{app_name} and see if “Hello, world!” popped out.\nBy this point, we were able to create a really simple website example that returns a text message. We are also able to create different apps and expand them with directories and went through the web part of Django server.\nObviously, a simple HTTP Response isn’t enough to properly display content. Django is able to automatically generate HTML markdown if properly told so. Templates are the ones who help us with that.\nWithout further ado let’s create a folder named templates in your app’s folder and place a file named base.html into it. Base.html is going to play a role of a simply configured HTML example which in the long run, allows us to omit work with HTML.\nContent of base.html is pretty basic and stays the same most of the time:\nNow, create some another blank HTML file (index.html) and include this code in it:\nAs seen here, it uses base.html as its basis and allows us to input any simple or slightly HTML-marked text in-between {% extends 'base.html'%} and {% endblock %}. Try changing Hello World to some other text and now we are ready to make it work!\nRemember what file is responsible for storing functions? views.py!\nHead over there and change the index function to this code which will automatically render your template from index.html\nNow check your text at http://IP:8000/{app_name}\nYou can create different templates for different functions and use them separately. For example, if you are creating a blog website, you might want to make templates for articles and homepage separately.\nIn case if it was hard for you to follow the guide, or you have any errors, head over to Unit 4 and find a github link there. I’ll upload an exact example of what I was talking about here so you can compare it with your code and easily troubleshoot.\n04: Concluding In case if it was hard for you to follow the guide, or you have any errors, here’s an exact example of the Django website I was talking about:\nhttps://github.com/Swafox/Django-example (If you still have any questions, feel free to reach me out on Discord. I’ll be happy to help.)\nIt is also possible to deploy your Django example for free! https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ Has a full support for Django applications with intuitive GUI.\nIn case if you enjoyed Django and want to go further, I would recommend these free sources:\nhttps://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ https://djangobook.com/mastering-django-2-book/ 05: CTF Enumeation Nmap sudo nmap -sC -sV -oN init 10.10.223.23 [snip] 22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0) | ssh-hostkey: | 2048 35:30:91:45:b9:d1:ed:5a:13:42:3e:20:95:6d:c7:b7 (RSA) | 256 f5:69:6a:7b:c8:ac:89:b5:38:93:50:2f:05:24:22:70 (ECDSA) |_ 256 8f:4d:37:ba:40:12:05:fa:f0:e6:d6:82:fb:65:52:e8 (ED25519) 8000/tcp open http-alt WSGIServer/0.2 CPython/3.6.9 [snip] If we go to http://:8000 we see a Django page with lots of messages about DISALLOWED HOSTS. Rings a bell from the tasks above? We should add the machine IP to the hosts before we can access the app. Let’s do that. Admin panel flag? SSH into machine by given creds:\nUsername: django-admin Password: roottoor1212 refered to Unit-2 we know we should change our ALLOWED_HOSTS in the app’s settings.py\nchange this line on settings.py:\nALLOWED_HOSTS = ['0.0.0.0', '10.10.147.62'] check the page again\nto read the admin flag let’s create a admin user account.\nNavigate to /home/django-admin/messagebox/\nExecute the command to create the superuser python3 manage.py createsuperuser\nFollow the prompts to create a username and password and you now have a super user account.\nBack on the admin page, you can use those credentials to login.\nOnce in, navigate through the not so many options and you should see a Users page.\nHere’s your first flag disguised as the First Name of the user Flag.\nUser flag? find local user home dir:\nls -la /home cd /home/StrangeFox ls cat user.txt THM{xxx} Hidden flag? run the magic ‘Grep’\ngrep -Rwi \"thm\"\nYou Shall find what you’re looking for!\n","wordCount":"1535","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://classroom.anir0y.in/img/Django.gif","datePublished":"2021-09-11T18:40:31+05:30","dateModified":"2021-09-11T18:40:31+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Animesh Roy"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://classroom.anir0y.in/post/tryhackme-django/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Classroom","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://classroom.anir0y.in/img/avatar.jpeg"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://classroom.anir0y.in/ accesskey=h title="Classroom (Alt + H)"><img src=https://classroom.anir0y.in/img/avatar.jpeg alt aria-label=logo height=35>Classroom</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

Try changing Hello World to some other text and now we are ready to make it work!</p><p>Remember what file is responsible for storing functions? views.py!</p><p>Head over there and change the index function to this code which will automatically render your template from index.html</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/bhOJxt0.png></p><p>Now check your text at http://IP:8000/{app_name}</p><p>You can create different templates for different functions and use them separately. For example, if you are creating a blog website, you might want to make templates for articles and homepage separately.</p><blockquote><p>In case if it was hard for you to follow the guide, or you have any errors, head over to Unit 4 and find a github link there.
