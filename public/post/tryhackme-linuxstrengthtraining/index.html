Find files with a specific keyword grep -iRl [directory path/keyword] grep -iRl ‘/folderA/flag’ read the manual for the find command man find man find Note: There are many more useful commands aside from the examples above. If you ever have trouble understanding any of the syntax or getting it to work, head on over to explainshell.com to check the syntax and see how this tool can help you on your journey to Linux greatness.\nFurther notes: if you do not know already, typing CTRL+L allows you to clear the screen quicker rather than typing ‘clear’ all the time. Additionally, hitting the up arrow allows you to return to a previously typed command so you do not have to spend time retyping it again if you made an error. Cool. Finally, placing: 2\u003e/dev/null at the end of your find command can help filter your results to exclude files/directories that you do not have permission to.\n2.2 What is the correct option for finding files based on group -group\n2.3 What is format for finding a file with the user named Francis and with a size of 52 kilobytes in the directory /home/francis/ find /home/francis/ -type f -user Francis -size 52k\n2.4 SSH as topson using his password topson. Go to the /home/topson/chatlogs directory and type the following: grep -iRl ‘keyword’. What is the name of the file that you found using this command? 2019-10-11\n2.6 What are the characters subsequent to the word you found? ttitor\n2.7 Read the file named ‘ReadMeIfStuck.txt’. What is the Flag? read the ‘ReadMeIfStuck.txt’ file:\ntopson@james:~$ cat ReadMeIfStuck.txt Looking for flag 1?:It seems you will have to think harder if you want to find the flag. Perhaps try looking for a file called `additionalHINT` if you can't find it.. Looking for flag 2?: look for a file named readME_hint.txt # stage 2 topson@james:~$ find . -type f -name additionalHINT ./channels/additionalHINT ## read the file topson@james:~$ cat ./channels/additionalHINT try to find a directory called telephone numbers... Oh wait.. it contains a space.. I wonder how we can find that.... # stage 3 topson@james:~$ find . -type d -name 'telephone numbers' ./corperateFiles/xch/telephone numbers topson@james:~$ ls -lhA './corperateFiles/xch/telephone numbers' total 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 topson topson 189 Oct 5 15:26 readME.txt topson@james:~$ cat './corperateFiles/xch/telephone numbers/readME.txt' 202-555-0150 202-555-0125 617-555-0115 +1-617-555-0115 +1-617-555-0186 +1-617-555-0138 use the Find command to find a file with a modified date of 2016-09-12 from the /workflows directory topson@james:~$ find workflows/ -type f -newermt 2016-09-11 ! -newermt 2016-09-13 workflows/xft/eBQRhHvx grep -oi '\\S*flag\\S*' workflows/xft/eBQRhHvx Flag{flag-was-here} NOTE:\n\\S is a regexp token to match any non-whitespace character -i to make case insensitive search -o to display only matching content Task 03: Working with files You should be somewhat familiar already with working with files. Similar to windows, we can do the following:\ncopy files and folders move files and folders rename files and folders create files and folders For a quick recap to train your mental memory on the commands please refer to the below information:\nA few additional things to remember is that occasionally you may encounter files/folders with special characters such as - (dash). Just remember that if you try to copy or move these files you will encounter errors because Linux interprets the - as a type of argument, therefore you will have to place – just before the filename. For example: cp – -filename.txt /home/folderExample.\n3.1 Hypothetically, you find yourself in a directory with many files and want to move all these files to the directory of /home/francis/logs. What is the correct command to do this? mv * /home/francis/logs\n3.2 Hypothetically, you want to transfer a file from your /home/james/Desktop/ with the name script.py to the remote machine (192.168.10.5) directory of /home/john/scripts using the username of john. What would be the full command to do this? scp /home/james/Desktop/script.py john@192.168.10.5:/home/john/scripts\n3.3 How would you rename a folder named -logs to -newlogs mv -- -logs -newlogs\n3.4 How would you copy the file named encryption keys to the directory of /home/john/logs cp encryption keys /home/john/logs\n3.5 Find a file named readME_hint.txt inside topson’s directory and read it. Using the instructions it gives you, get the second flag. let’s read the 2nd flag\n# find `readME_hint.txt` topson@james:~$ find . -type f -name readME_hint.txt ./corperateFiles/RecordsFinances/readME_hint.txt #read the file topson@james:~$ cat ./corperateFiles/RecordsFinances/readME_hint.txt Instructions: Move the MoveMe.txt file to the march folder directory and then execute the SH program to reveal the second flag. you need to research three things: how to execute bash files how to work with files that begin with a - (dash) whether that is to do with copying or moving files how to work with files with spaces ### follow the instructions for flag2 topson@james:~/corperateFiles/RecordsFinances$ mv -- -MoveMe.txt '-march folder' topson@james:~/corperateFiles/RecordsFinances$ cd -- '-march folder' topson@james:~/corperateFiles/RecordsFinances/-march folder$ bash -- -runME.sh -MoveMe.txt exists. Flag{flag-was-here} Task 04: Hashing - introduction 4.1 Download the hash file attached to this task and attempt to crack the MD5 hash.

The database server is down, and I really need to help a customer out. (2020-08-13) Sameer: Sure. let me check. (2020-08-13) Sarah: Thanks. (2020-08-13) Sameer: check the home/shared/sql/ directory. It should be in there with the date of today. (2020-08-13) Sarah: Thank you Sameer. (2020-08-13) Sameer: No problem. It probably is encrypted. Just use the password: `danepon`. (2020-08-13) Sarah: OK, thank you. (2020-08-13) Sameer: No problem (2020-08-13) Sameer: By the way, if you have any issues just talk to Michael as I will be off for the remainder of the day. See you tomorrow. Bye. (2020-08-13) Sarah: Bye. SQL backup should be in /home/shared/sql/ and encrypted with the password danepon.\nsarah@james:~$ cat /home/shared/chatlogs/KfnP (2020-08-13) Sarah: Michael, I have been having trouble accessing the sql database back-up copy made today. Sameer gave me the password, but it just will not work? (2020-08-13) Michael: Ah, yes. I remember, the security engineer was testing out a new automated software for creating sql database backups. He must have configured it to encrypt the backups with a different password. (2020-08-13) Sarah: So how can I get a hold of it? (2020-08-13) Michael: Good question. From what I remember the test program utilised a configuration file around 50mb. It is located inside the home/shared/sql/conf directory. This configuration file contained the directory location of a wordlist it used to randomly select a password from for encrypting the sql back-up copies with. (2020-08-13) Sarah: I do not really understand the last part? (2020-08-13) Michael: once you find the configuration file and consequently the wordlist directory, visit it. One of those wordlists must contain the password it used for the testing. All I remember is that the password began with ebq. You will need Sameer’s account. His SSH password is: `thegreatestpasswordever000`.
