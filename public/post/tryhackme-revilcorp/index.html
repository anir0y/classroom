After looking at the user’s workstation, the IT guy already knew what was going on and transferred the case to the Incident Response team for further investigation.\nYou are the incident responder. Let’s see if you can solve this challenge using the infamous Redline tool. Happy Hunting, my friend!\nTo start your investigation, open the Mandiant Analysis file in the Analysis File folder on the Desktop.\nAnswer the questions below Task Question Ans 1 What is the compromised employee’s full name? employee name 2 What is the operating system of the compromised host? windows host 3 What is the name of the malicious executable that the user opened? malware 4 What is the full URL that the user visited to download the malicious binary? (include the binary as well) File download Url 5 What is the MD5 hash of the binary? hash 6 What is the size of the binary in kilobytes? binary size 7 What is the extension to which the user’s files got renamed? renamed files 8 What is the number of files that got renamed and changed to that extension? number of files renamed 9 What is the full path to the wallpaper that got changed by an attacker, including the image name? hacker wallpaper 10 The attacker left a note for the user on the Desktop; provide the name of the note with the extension. hacker notes 11 The attacker created a folder “Links for United States” under C:\\Users\\John Coleman\\Favorites\\ and left a file there. Provide the name of the file. hacker links 12 There is a hidden file that was created on the user’s Desktop that has 0 bytes. Provide the name of the hidden file. size zero 13 The user downloaded a decryptor hoping to decrypt all the files, but he failed. Provide the MD5 hash of the decryptor file. decrypt.exe 14 In the ransomware note, the attacker provided a URL that is accessible through the normal browser in order to decrypt one of the encrypted files for free. The user attempted to visit it. Provide the full URL path. history 15 What are some three names associated with the malware which infected this host? (enter the names in alphabetical order) OTX compromised employee What is the operating system of the compromised host? find the info on system informaiton page\nmalicious executable user might have been downloaded malicious executable using web/email. let’s check download history to find the ans. full URL ref to task 3 we can copy and paste the URL\nMD5 hash of the binary click on timeline search for the malicious [executable](#malicious-executable) click on result search for next eventually you’ll see hash either on right side of result or you can click on show detail for better copy/paste! size of binary ref to full url or md5sum both have file size. files got renamed click on file system select folders form user you’ll notice a not common extention name for few files. that’s the answer!
