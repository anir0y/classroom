At the moment Windows dominates the word of computers with around 90% market share and it overtook Apple (Mac OS) which was introduced in 1984.\nWindows versions:\nWindows 1 Windows 2 Windows 2.x Windows 3.x Windows 95 Windows 98 Windows NT Windows XP Windows Vista Windows 7 Windows 8.x Windows 10 Windows server versions:\nWindows Server 2008 Windows Server 2003 Windows Server 2012 / 2012 R2 Windows Server 2016 Windows Server 2019 FLAG question ans Read a little about Windows history and versions. n/a When was Windows announced? November 20 1985 Which is the latest version of Windows that was mentioned? Windows 10 Which is the latest version of Windows Server presented? Windows Server 2019 Task 02: Windows file system and permissions explained What is the file system? It is the method and data structure that an operating system uses to keep track of files on a disk or partition. Without a file system, the information saved in a storage media would be one large body of data with no way to tell where the information begins and ends.\nWindows file system structure is:\nLogical drives (Ex: Local Disk C) Folders (these are the folders that come by default. Ex: Documents, Downloads, Music) Files Something that might also interest you would be the folders located on the C drive and their role. These folders are:\nPerfLogs Program Files Program Files (x86) Users Windows Let me break them down and explain each of them:\nPerfLogs - Stores the system issues and other reports regarding performance Program Files and Program Files (x86) - Is the location where programs install unless you change their path (Ex: Choosing to install software on D drive) Users - In this folder are stored the users created. It also stores users generated data (Ex: Saving a file on your Desktop) Windows - It’s the folder which basically contains the code to run the operating system and some utility tools (we’ll talk about them later) File permissions FIles permissions can be set by an administrator or a privileged account. These permissions can be applied to:\nUsers Groups Permissions that can be set are:\nFull control\nModify\nRead \u0026 execute\nList folders content\nRead\nWrite\nSpecial permissions\nFull control - allows the user/users/group/groups to set the ownership of the folder, set permission for others, modify, read, write, and execute files.\nModify - allows the user/users/group/groups to modify, read, write, and execute files.\nRead \u0026 execute - allows the user/users/group/groups to read and execute files.\nList folder contents - allows the user/users/group/groups to list the contents (files, subfolders, etc) of a folder.\nRead - only allows the user/users/group/groups to read files.\nWrite - allows the user/users/group/groups to write data to the specified folder (automatically set when “Modify” right is checked).\nNote: You can allow or deny permissions for users or groups. To set permissions for a file or folder right click on the file and select “Properties”. Go to the “Security” tab and click on the “Edit” button.\nAs you can see Users can only read, execute, and list the folder contents. However, we want to allow them to be able to store, edit, or delete files inside that folder. To do that, check the “Modify” box (you will see that by checking the Modify box the Write box will be automatically checked too).\nTo apply the changes click on the “Apply” button.\nThe reason we do not set the full control permission on the folder is that users could set permissions and take ownership of the folder themselves (without the action of an administrator/privileged user).\nA tool you can use to check the files or folder permissions is “icacls”.\nLet’s explain what those letters in parentheses mean as right now you might be confused.\nI - permission inherited from the parent container\nF - full access (full control)\nM - Modify right/access\nOI - object inherit\nIO - inherit only\nCI - container inherit\nRX - read and execute\nAD - append data (add subdirectories)\nWD - write data and add files\nYou can use icacls to check permissions, set ownership of the folder, set, remove or deny permissions. An example would be setting the ownership of the folder to Users.\nTo check if that applied you can right-click on the folder and select “Properties”, go to the “Security” tab, and click on “Advanced”. There you should be able to see that the owner is “Users”.\nFLAG-2 question ans na na In which folder are users profiles stored? users Task 03: Understanding the authentication process What is authentication? Authentication is a process for verifying the identity of a person (or an object or a service). When you authenticate a person, the goal is to verify that the person is not an imposter.\nLocal authentication Local authentication is done using the Local Security Authority (LSA). LSA is a protected subsystem that keeps track of the security policies and the accounts that are on a computer system. It also maintains information about all aspects of local security on a computer.\nTypes of Active Directory There are two types of Active Directory:\nOn-Premise Active Directory (AD) Azure Active Directory (AAD) Authentication on On-Premise Active Directory On-premise Active Directory has a record of all users, PCs and Servers and authenticates the users signing in (the network logon). Once signed in, Active Directory also governs what the users are, and are not, allowed to do or access (authorization).\nIn an on-premise Active Directory environment the authentication can be made by using the following protocols:\nNTLM LDAP / LDAPS KERBEROS NTLM / NTLM 2 NTLM uses a challenge-response sequence of messages between a client and a server system. NTLM provides authentication based on a challenge-response authentication scheme. It does not provide data integrity or data confidentiality protection for the authenticated network connection.\nLDAP / LDAPS The main difference between LDAP and LDAPS is that LDAPS support encryption and therefore the credentials are not sent in plain text across the network.\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that the Domain Controller (DC) can be considered a database of users, groups, computers and so on (contains information about objects). Using LDAP/LDAPS the user’s workstation sends the credentials using an API to the Domain Controller in order to validate them and be able to log in.\nThe procedure is similar to the image below:\nKERBEROS Another way to authenticate is using Kerberos. Kerberos uses symmetric-key cryptography and requires trusted third-party authorization to verify user identities. The authentication process is similar to the one below:\nAuthentication on Azure Active Directory Azure Active Directory is a secure online authentication store, which can contain users and groups. Users have a username and a password which are used when you sign in to an application that uses Azure Active Directory for authentication. So, for example, all of the Microsoft Cloud services use Azure Active Directory for authentication: Office 365, Dynamics 365 and Azure. Azure Active Directory supports the following authentication methods:\nSAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) OAUTH 2.0 OpenID Connect SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is a type of Single Sign-On (SSO) standard. It defines a set of rules/protocols that allow users to access web applications with a single login. This is possible because those applications (referred to as “Service Providers”) all trust the systems that verify users’ identities (referred to as “Identity Providers”).\nService Providers - These are the systems and applications that users access throughout the day.\nIdentity Providers - This would be the system that performs user authentication.\nOAUTH 2.0 OAuth 2.0 is a standard that apps use to provide client applications with access.\nOAuth 2.0 spec has four important roles:\nThe authorization server, which is the server that issues the access token. The resource owner, normally your application’s end-user, that grants permission to access the resource server with an access token. The client, which is the application that requests the access token, and then passes it to the resource server. The resource server, which accepts the access token and must verify that it is valid. In this case, this is your application. OpenID Connect OpenID Connect is an authentication standard built on top of OAuth 2.0. It adds an additional token called an ID token.\nFor that, it uses simple JSON Web Tokens (JWT). While OAuth 2.0 is about resource access and sharing, OIDC is all about user authentication\nFLAG-3 question ans Read the above. n\\a Which Active Directory is cloud based? Azure Active Directory Which authentication method does not provide data integrity? NTLM Authentication method that assings a ticket in order for a user to login? KERBEROS Which authentication method allow users to access applications with a single login (short name)? SAML Authentication method that uses JSON Web Tokens? OpenID Connect Task 04: Utility tools Built-in utility tools Windows comes with a variety of utility tools. Some of them are:\nComputer Management Local Security Policy Disk Cleanup Registry Editor Command-line tools Registry Editor (Regedit) Let’s break each of them down and see their usage and why they are important. Computer Management Computer Management contains more tools such as:\nTask Scheduler Event Viewer Shared Folders Local users \u0026 computers Performance Monitor Disk Management Services \u0026 Applications Task Scheduler - This is a tool that allows predefined actions to be automatically executed whenever a certain set of conditions is met(Ex: You can set up a date and time for a piece of software to be installed, or a script to run).\nEvent Viewer - Probably one of the most important tools that come with Windows. The Event Viewer logs events that happen across the device (Ex: Successful \u0026 Failed login attempts, System Errors, etc). The reason Event Viewer is important is because it can be used to forward the events to a SIEM (Security Information and Event Manager) which helps the IT team of a company determine possible malicious activities.\nShared Folders - Is a directory or a folder that can be shared across the network and can be accessed by multiple users.\nLocal users and computers - Using local users and computers we can create users, add them to different built-in groups, and they can be given different levels of access (Ex: User A can connect through RDP to a machine but user B can’t).\nPerformance Monitor -Performance Monitor monitors the different activities across the device such as CPU usage, memory usage, etc.\nDisk Management - Using Disk Management you can shrink, expand, create new partitions (drives) and format the partitions.\nServices \u0026 Applications - It is possible to check the running services on the system and you have the ability to start, stop or restart them.\nLocal Security Policy Local Security Policy is a group of settings you can configure to strengthen the computer’s security. Even though most policy settings in Windows are fine, there are a few that need adjusting for enhanced security. You can set the minimum password length, the password complexity level, you can disable guest \u0026 local administrator accounts, and many more.\nNote: If the computer is not integrated into an Active Directory environment disabling local administrator account is a bad idea.\nDisk Cleanup Another useful utility is Disk Cleanup. Using Disk Cleanup we can delete files that are no longer needed by the system and are just adding up to the computer disk space. Running Disk Cleanup as administrator we can also clean system files (Ex: sometimes, after getting updates some files remain on disk, but these are no longer needed). To access Disk Cleanup right-click on Local Disk C and click Properties. You should see a button in the General tab named “Disk Cleanup”.\nYou just need to tick the box/files you want to clean and press OK.\nRegistry Editor The Windows registry database stores many important operating system settings. For example, it contains entries with information about what should happen when double-clicking a particular file type or how wide the taskbar should be. Built-in and inserted hardware also stores information in the registry when the driver is installed; this driver is called up every time the system is booted up.\nTo access the Registry Editor you can either search it or use Windows Key + R and type RegEdit.\nCommand-line tools Windows comes equipped with two command-line tools:\nCMD Powershell Windows Terminal CMD is the command-line interpreter for Microsoft Windows operating systems used to automate various system-related tasks using scripts and batch files. Users can interact with the OS directly using text-based commands. It emulates most of the command line abilities available in MS-DOS through a command-line interface.\nPowershell is mainly used by sysadmins to manage the network and domain they handle, as well as the computers and other devices that are part of it. PowerShell is a scripting language. The PowerShell can interpret batch commands and Powershell commands, but the command prompt can only interpret batch commands.\nBoth CMD and Powershell are powerful command-line tools used to automate system administration tasks by writing a script/batch file. However, CMD has limited administration capabilities as compared to Powershell, which, on the other hand, is a more advanced and modern shell implementation with additional features and enhancements (Ex: cmdlets).\nWindows Terminal can be used instead of Powershell and CMD and can be installed from the Microsoft Store. The application includes multiple tab support, alongside themes and customization for developers who want to tweak the Terminal.\nRegistry Editor Registry Editor can be considered a database that contains low-level settings for Microsoft Windows settings and applications. The registries are structured as follows:\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT HKEY_CURRENT_USER HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE HKEY_USERS HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG\nA feature of Powershell is that you can browse the registries. You can do that by typing: “cd ” (Example: cd HKLM:).\nWindows also has a builtin tool named “reg” which can be used from the command line to add, remove, query, import, export, etc registry keys.\nThere is also available a GUI that can be used. You can search for “Regedit” or type it in the command line.\nThere is no point to remember the paths for some settings that are located in the registry editor. You can look up for the settings on the internet.\nTask 05: Types of servers What is a server? A server is a piece of hardware or software equipment that provides functionality for other softwares or devices.\nTypes of servers Servers can be used for a variety of actions or things. The most common ones are:\nDomain Controller File server Web server FTP Server Mail Server Database Server Proxy Server Application Server Domain Controller - Might be one of the most important servers because in an AD or AAD infrastructure we can control users, groups, restrict actions, improve security, and many more of other computers and servers.\nFile Server - File servers provide a great way to share files across devices on a network.\nWeb Server- It serves static or dynamic content to a Web browser by loading a file from a disk and serving it across the network to a user’s Web browser.\nFTP Server - Makes possible moving one or more files securely between computers while providing file security and organization as well as transfer control.\nMail Server - Mail servers move and store mail over corporate networks (via LANs and WANs) and across the Internet.\nDatabase Server - A database server is a computer system that provides other computers with services related to accessing and retrieving data from one or multiple databases.\nProxy Server - This server usually sits between a client program and an external server to filter requests, improve performance, and share connections.\nApplication Server - They’re usually used to connect the database servers and the users.\nFLAG-5 question ans Read the above. Which can be considered the most important server? Domain Controller Which server can store emails? Mail Server Task 06: Users and Groups Management Users and Groups Management in Active Directory Deploy the machine and authenticate using RDP (on Windows) or Remmina/Xfreerdp (on Linux) with the user: Administrator:tryhackme123!\nIn Active Directory user management is done using the Active Directory Users and Computers. To access it go to Tools \u003e Active Directory Users and Computers.\nBefore any other action let’s enable Advanced Features which adds additional features when looking at an object properties. That is doable by going to View \u003e Advanced Features.\nBy double-clicking on thm.lab we are presented with the Active Directory tree.\nLet’s create an Organizational Unit (OU) where to store the users. To do that right-click on the domain name (thm.lab) and go to New \u003e Organizational Unit. I named it LAB and clicked OK to create it.\nLet’s create two more OUs inside the newly created OU (it will look nested). In one OU we’ll store users and in the second one, we’ll store Groups. To create the OU’s we can repeat the steps above (Right-click on LAB OU \u003e New \u003e Organizational Unit).\nTime to create some users and groups! To do so right-click on the Users OU and go to New \u003e User and fill in the information required.\nClick Next and set a password for the user.\nThe reason I checked only “Password never expires” is because I do not want the password to expire after a period of time (the default period of time in AD is 42 days). In a production environment, you would probably check “User must change password at next logon” so the user can set a password he desires after you created his AD account.\nSince the password can be set to expire after a period of time it would be a bad idea to check the “User cannot change password” because he won’t be able to reset the password and you will have to manually intervene.\nAs for the last box “Disable account” it’s obvious the action that will take place. It will disable the user account. You might want to disable a user account in case he has a leave (let’s say 6 months leave) and you do not want him or any other colleague or malicious entity to use his account.\nClick on Next and you will be shown the account information and click Finish to finish the account creation.\nNote: The username that is going to be used by the user in order to authenticate is the one you set in the User Logon Name.\nYou’ve successfully created your first AD user. Now, create two more users and name them as you wish.\nWe should have three users in the AD:\nLet’s move to the Groups OU. Right click on the OU \u003e New \u003e Group.\nI named the group Admins and clicked OK to create it.\nThen I created another group named RDP Access.\nAnd finally using the same method create one more group named No RDP Access.\nWe should have the following groups in AD:\nTo assign a user to a group you can do that in two ways:\nRight-clicking a user \u003e Add to a group\nDouble-clicking a group \u003e click on Members tab \u003e Add\nUsing the first method let’s add Albert Einstein to the Admins group. A window will be prompted to search for an object in the AD. You can type in the Enter object name to select field the name of the group created (in my case Admins), click Check Names, and OK to add the user to the specified group.\nProceed to add one of the created users to the RDP Access group and the other to the No RDP Access group.\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that an object can be a member of another object (Ex: A group can be a member of another group).\nWe added Albert Einstein to a group named Admins. Let’s add the Admins group to the Domain Admins group. To do that we can right-click on Admins group \u003e Add to a group and search for Domain Admins and press OK.\nAs we’ve done with Albert Einstein’s account, add both RDP Access and No RDP Access groups to the Remote Desktop Users group\nNote: Even though adding the No RDP Access group to the RDP Users group the No RDP Access group can be blocked using GPO. This will be done in the next task (Creating your first GPO).\nTask 07: Creating your first GPO What is Group Policy Objects? A GPO or a Group Policy Object is a feature of Active Directory that adds additional controls to user accounts and computers.\nGroup Policy settings including local settings, site-wide settings, domain-level settings and settings applied to organizational units.\nCreating our first GPO To create a GPO we need to go to Tools \u003e Group Policy Management inside the Server Manager.\nRight-click on “Group Policy Objects” and create a new object. I will name mine “Groups GPO”. To edit the GPO right-click on it \u003e Edit.\nFor the purpose of this demo, we will set different permissions for the groups recently created.\nFirst, let’s let users authenticate using RDP. To do so, go to Policies \u003e Windows Settings \u003e Security Settings \u003e Local Policies \u003e Users Right Assignment and double click on Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services.\nSelect Define these policy settings \u003e Add user or group \u003e Browse\nSearch for Admins and RDP Access groups and click OK \u003e OK to add them.\nTo block a user or a group to login using RDP we can do that by double-clicking Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services and adding No RDP Access group in there.\nWe can close the editor and go back to our Group Policy Management console/tab/panel. In order to make the policy apply, we have to link the GPO to the root of the domain (thm.lab). To do that right-click on Domain Controllers OU \u003e Link an existing GPO and select the GPO you created (Group GPO in my case) and press OK.\nTo apply the GPO open a CMD as an administrator (right-click on it \u003e Run as administrator) and type the following: gpupdate /force and wait for the policy to apply.\nTesting the GPO Let’s try to RDP into the machine using each user and see the different level of access each has.\nThe first user I’m going to login is Albert Einstein which has Domain Admin rights. The logon is successful. Open a CMD as admin and type “whoami”.\nAs noticed we were able to start an elevated CMD.\nSign out and log in using the account added to RDP Access group (In my case Jim Carrey).\nTry prompting an elevated CMD (Right-click on CMD \u003e Run as administrator). You notice that UAC (User Account Control) asks for admin credentials. If you try entering the credentials (username and password) of the account you are currently logged in you will notice the CMD prompt will not pop out. This happens because you are a simple user on the machine, not an administrator.\nNote: You can spawn the shell if you use an administrator credential (in my case Albert Einstein).\nLastly, try logging in with the account added to the No RDP Access. You will get the following error:\nThis happens because even though the No RDP Access group has been added to the Remote Desktop Users group using the GPO earlier created he have blocked RDP access to the users that are in that group.\n","wordCount":"3931","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://classroom.anir0y.in/img/thm.gif","datePublished":"2021-08-24T15:17:46+05:30","dateModified":"2021-08-24T15:17:46+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Animesh Roy"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://classroom.anir0y.in/post/tryhackme-intro2winold/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Classroom","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://classroom.anir0y.in/img/avatar.jpeg"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://classroom.anir0y.in/ accesskey=h title="Classroom (Alt + H)"><img src=https://classroom.anir0y.in/img/avatar.jpeg alt aria-label=logo height=35>Classroom</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

Without a file system, the information saved in a storage media would be one large body of data with no way to tell where the information begins and ends.</p><p>Windows file system structure is:</p><ul><li>Logical drives (Ex: Local Disk C)</li><li>Folders (these are the folders that come by default. Ex: Documents, Downloads, Music)</li><li>Files</li></ul><p>Something that might also interest you would be the folders located on the C drive and their role. These folders are:</p><ul><li>PerfLogs</li><li>Program Files</li><li>Program Files (x86)</li><li>Users</li><li>Windows</li></ul><p>Let me break them down and explain each of them:</p><ul><li>PerfLogs - Stores the system issues and other reports regarding performance</li><li>Program Files and Program Files (x86) - Is the location where programs install unless you change their path (Ex: Choosing to install software on D drive)</li><li>Users - In this folder are stored the users created. It also stores users generated data (Ex: Saving a file on your Desktop)</li><li>Windows - It&rsquo;s the folder which basically contains the code to run the operating system and some utility tools (we&rsquo;ll talk about them later)</li></ul><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/vt6gQJ3.png></p><h3 id=file-permissions>File permissions<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#file-permissions>#</a></h3><p>FIles permissions can be set by an administrator or a privileged account. These permissions can be applied to:</p><ul><li>Users</li><li>Groups</li></ul><p>Permissions that can be set are:</p><ul><li><p>Full control</p></li><li><p>Modify</p></li><li><p>Read & execute</p></li><li><p>List folders content</p></li><li><p>Read</p></li><li><p>Write</p></li><li><p>Special permissions</p><p>Full control - allows the user/users/group/groups to set the ownership of the folder, set permission for others, modify, read, write, and execute files.</p><p>Modify - allows the user/users/group/groups to modify, read, write, and execute files.</p><p>Read & execute - allows the user/users/group/groups to read and execute files.</p><p>List folder contents - allows the user/users/group/groups to list the contents (files, subfolders, etc) of a folder.</p><p>Read - only allows the user/users/group/groups to read files.</p><p>Write - allows the user/users/group/groups to write data to the specified folder (automatically set when &ldquo;Modify&rdquo; right is checked).</p></li></ul><p>Note: You can allow or deny permissions for users or groups.
To set permissions for a file or folder right click on the file and select &ldquo;Properties&rdquo;. Go to the &ldquo;Security&rdquo; tab and click on the &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; button.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/dyjgXwr.png></p><p>As you can see Users can only read, execute, and list the folder contents. However, we want to allow them to be able to store, edit, or delete files inside that folder. To do that, check the &ldquo;Modify&rdquo; box (you will see that by checking the Modify box the Write box will be automatically checked too).</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/EXrRHVE.png></p><p>To apply the changes click on the &ldquo;Apply&rdquo; button.</p><p>The reason we do not set the full control permission on the folder is that users could set permissions and take ownership of the folder themselves (without the action of an administrator/privileged user).</p><p>A tool you can use to check the files or folder permissions is &ldquo;icacls&rdquo;.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/g0b0Pa8.png></p><p>Let&rsquo;s explain what those letters in parentheses mean as right now you might be confused.</p><p>I - permission inherited from the parent container</p><p>F - full access (full control)</p><p>M - Modify right/access</p><p>OI - object inherit</p><p>IO - inherit only</p><p>CI - container inherit</p><p>RX - read and execute</p><p>AD - append data (add subdirectories)</p><p>WD - write data and add files</p><p>You can use icacls to check permissions, set ownership of the folder, set, remove or deny permissions. An example would be setting the ownership of the folder to Users.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/mFlrbGE.png></p><p>To check if that applied you can right-click on the folder and select &ldquo;Properties&rdquo;, go to the &ldquo;Security&rdquo; tab, and click on &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo;. There you should be able to see that the owner is &ldquo;Users&rdquo;.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/VmxCs86.png></p><h3 id=flag-2>FLAG-2<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#flag-2>#</a></h3><table><thead><tr><th>question</th><th>ans</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>na</td><td>na</td></tr><tr><td>In which folder are users profiles stored?</td><td><code>users</code></td></tr></tbody></table><hr><script async src=https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js></script><p><ins class=adsbygoogle style=display:block;text-align:center data-ad-layout=in-article data-ad-format=fluid data-ad-client=ca-pub-3526678290068011 data-ad-slot=7160066188></ins></p><script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({})</script><hr><h2 id=task-03-understanding-the-authentication-process>Task 03: Understanding the authentication process<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#task-03-understanding-the-authentication-process>#</a></h2><h3 id=what-is-authentication>What is authentication?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-is-authentication>#</a></h3><p>Authentication is a process for verifying the identity of a person (or an object or a service). When you authenticate a person, the goal is to verify that the person is not an imposter.</p><h3 id=local-authentication>Local authentication<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#local-authentication>#</a></h3><p>Local authentication is done using the Local Security Authority (LSA). LSA is a protected subsystem that keeps track of the security policies and the accounts that are on a computer system. It also maintains information about all aspects of local security on a computer.</p><h3 id=types-of-active-directory>Types of Active Directory<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#types-of-active-directory>#</a></h3><p>There are two types of Active Directory:</p><ul><li>On-Premise Active Directory (AD)</li><li>Azure Active Directory (AAD)</li></ul><h3 id=authentication-on-on-premise-active-directory>Authentication on On-Premise Active Directory<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#authentication-on-on-premise-active-directory>#</a></h3><p>On-premise Active Directory has a record of all users, PCs and Servers and authenticates the users signing in (the network logon). Once signed in, Active Directory also governs what the users are, and are not, allowed to do or access (authorization).</p><p>In an on-premise Active Directory environment the authentication can be made by using the following protocols:</p><ul><li>NTLM</li><li>LDAP / LDAPS</li><li>KERBEROS</li></ul><h3 id=ntlm--ntlm-2>NTLM / NTLM 2<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ntlm--ntlm-2>#</a></h3><p>NTLM uses a challenge-response sequence of messages between a client and a server system. NTLM provides authentication based on a challenge-response authentication scheme. It does not provide data integrity or data confidentiality protection for the authenticated network connection.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/z7VT6PM.png></p><h3 id=ldap--ldaps>LDAP / LDAPS<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ldap--ldaps>#</a></h3><p>The main difference between LDAP and LDAPS is that LDAPS support encryption and therefore the credentials are not sent in plain text across the network.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that the Domain Controller (DC) can be considered a database of users, groups, computers and so on (contains information about objects). Using LDAP/LDAPS the user&rsquo;s workstation sends the credentials using an API to the Domain Controller in order to validate them and be able to log in.</p><p>The procedure is similar to the image below:</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/Vep5s0C.png></p><h3 id=kerberos>KERBEROS<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#kerberos>#</a></h3><p>Another way to authenticate is using Kerberos. Kerberos uses symmetric-key cryptography and requires trusted third-party authorization to verify user identities. The authentication process is similar to the one below:</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/nnsV5NM.png></p><h3 id=authentication-on-azure-active-directory>Authentication on Azure Active Directory<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#authentication-on-azure-active-directory>#</a></h3><p>Azure Active Directory is a secure online authentication store, which can contain users and groups. Users have a username and a password which are used when you sign in to an application that uses Azure Active Directory for authentication. So, for example, all of the Microsoft Cloud services use Azure Active Directory for authentication: Office 365, Dynamics 365 and Azure.
Azure Active Directory supports the following authentication methods:</p><ul><li>SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)</li><li>OAUTH 2.0</li><li>OpenID Connect</li></ul><h4 id=saml-security-assertion-markup-language>SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#saml-security-assertion-markup-language>#</a></h4><p>Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is a type of Single Sign-On (SSO) standard. It defines a set of rules/protocols that allow users to access web applications with a single login. This is possible because those applications (referred to as “Service Providers”) all trust the systems that verify users’ identities (referred to as “Identity Providers”).</p><p>Service Providers - These are the systems and applications that users access throughout the day.</p><p>Identity Providers - This would be the system that performs user authentication.</p><h4 id=oauth-20>OAUTH 2.0<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#oauth-20>#</a></h4><p>OAuth 2.0 is a standard that apps use to provide client applications with access.</p><p>OAuth 2.0 spec has four important roles:</p><ul><li>The authorization server, which is the server that issues the access token.</li><li>The resource owner, normally your application&rsquo;s end-user, that grants permission to access the resource server with an access token.</li><li>The client, which is the application that requests the access token, and then passes it to the resource server.</li><li>The resource server, which accepts the access token and must verify that it is valid. In this case, this is your application.</li></ul><h4 id=openid-connect>OpenID Connect<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#openid-connect>#</a></h4><p>OpenID Connect is an authentication standard built on top of OAuth 2.0. It adds an additional token called an ID token.</p><p>For that, it uses simple JSON Web Tokens (JWT). While OAuth 2.0 is about resource access and sharing, OIDC is all about user authentication</p><h3 id=flag-3>FLAG-3<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#flag-3>#</a></h3><table><thead><tr><th>question</th><th>ans</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Read the above.</td><td><code>n\a</code></td></tr><tr><td>Which Active Directory is cloud based?</td><td><code>Azure Active Directory</code></td></tr><tr><td>Which authentication method does not provide data integrity?</td><td><code>NTLM</code></td></tr><tr><td>Authentication method that assings a ticket in order for a user to login?</td><td><code>KERBEROS</code></td></tr><tr><td>Which authentication method allow users to access applications with a single login (short name)?</td><td><code>SAML</code></td></tr><tr><td>Authentication method that uses JSON Web Tokens?</td><td><code>OpenID Connect</code></td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h2 id=task-04-utility-tools>Task 04: Utility tools<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#task-04-utility-tools>#</a></h2><h3 id=built-in-utility-tools>Built-in utility tools<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#built-in-utility-tools>#</a></h3><p>Windows comes with a variety of utility tools. Some of them are:</p><ul><li>Computer Management</li><li>Local Security Policy</li><li>Disk Cleanup</li><li>Registry Editor</li><li>Command-line tools</li><li>Registry Editor (Regedit)
Let&rsquo;s break each of them down and see their usage and why they are important.</li></ul><h4 id=computer-management>Computer Management<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#computer-management>#</a></h4><p>Computer Management contains more tools such as:</p><ul><li>Task Scheduler</li><li>Event Viewer</li><li>Shared Folders</li><li>Local users & computers</li><li>Performance Monitor</li><li>Disk Management</li><li>Services & Applications</li></ul><p>Task Scheduler - This is a tool that allows predefined actions to be automatically executed whenever a certain set of conditions is met(Ex: You can set up a date and time for a piece of software to be installed, or a script to run).</p><p>Event Viewer - Probably one of the most important tools that come with Windows. The Event Viewer logs events that happen across the device (Ex: Successful & Failed login attempts, System Errors, etc). The reason Event Viewer is important is because it can be used to forward the events to a SIEM (Security Information and Event Manager) which helps the IT team of a company determine possible malicious activities.</p><p>Shared Folders - Is a directory or a folder that can be shared across the network and can be accessed by multiple users.</p><p>Local users and computers - Using local users and computers we can create users, add them to different built-in groups, and they can be given different levels of access (Ex: User A can connect through RDP to a machine but user B can&rsquo;t).</p><p>Performance Monitor -Performance Monitor monitors the different activities across the device such as CPU usage, memory usage, etc.</p><p>Disk Management - Using Disk Management you can shrink, expand, create new partitions (drives) and format the partitions.</p><p>Services & Applications - It is possible to check the running services on the system and you have the ability to start, stop or restart them.</p><h4 id=local-security-policy>Local Security Policy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#local-security-policy>#</a></h4><p>Local Security Policy is a group of settings you can configure to strengthen the computer&rsquo;s security. Even though
most policy settings in Windows are fine, there are a few that need adjusting for enhanced security. You can set the minimum password length, the password complexity level, you can disable guest & local administrator accounts, and many more.</p><p>Note: If the computer is not integrated into an Active Directory environment disabling local administrator account is a bad idea.</p><h4 id=disk-cleanup>Disk Cleanup<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#disk-cleanup>#</a></h4><p>Another useful utility is Disk Cleanup. Using Disk Cleanup we can delete files that are no longer needed by the system and are just adding up to the computer disk space. Running Disk Cleanup as administrator we can also clean system files (Ex: sometimes, after getting updates some files remain on disk, but these are no longer needed).
To access Disk Cleanup right-click on Local Disk C and click Properties. You should see a button in the General tab named &ldquo;Disk Cleanup&rdquo;.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/8GdfO9P.png></p><p>You just need to tick the box/files you want to clean and press OK.</p><h4 id=registry-editor>Registry Editor<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#registry-editor>#</a></h4><p>The Windows registry database stores many important operating system settings. For example, it contains entries with information about what should happen when double-clicking a particular file type or how wide the taskbar should be. Built-in and inserted hardware also stores information in the registry when the driver is installed; this driver is called up every time the system is booted up.</p><p>To access the Registry Editor you can either search it or use Windows Key + R and type RegEdit.</p><h4 id=command-line-tools>Command-line tools<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#command-line-tools>#</a></h4><p>Windows comes equipped with two command-line tools:</p><ul><li>CMD</li><li>Powershell</li><li>Windows Terminal</li></ul><p><strong>CMD</strong> is the command-line interpreter for Microsoft Windows operating systems used to automate various system-related tasks using scripts and batch files. Users can interact with the OS directly using text-based commands. It emulates most of the command line abilities available in MS-DOS through a command-line interface.</p><p><strong>Powershell</strong> is mainly used by sysadmins to manage the network and domain they handle, as well as the computers and other devices that are part of it. PowerShell is a scripting language. The PowerShell can interpret batch commands and Powershell commands, but the command prompt can only interpret batch commands.</p><p>Both CMD and Powershell are powerful command-line tools used to automate system administration tasks by writing a script/batch file. However, CMD has limited administration capabilities as compared to Powershell, which, on the other hand, is a more advanced and modern shell implementation with additional features and enhancements (Ex: cmdlets).</p><p><strong>Windows Terminal</strong> can be used instead of Powershell and CMD and can be installed from the Microsoft Store. The application includes multiple tab support, alongside themes and customization for developers who want to tweak the Terminal.</p><h4 id=registry-editor-1>Registry Editor<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#registry-editor-1>#</a></h4><p>Registry Editor can be considered a database that contains low-level settings for Microsoft Windows settings and applications. The registries are structured as follows:</p><p>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
HKEY_CURRENT_USER
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
HKEY_USERS
HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/5iUP2ZR.png></p><p>A feature of Powershell is that you can browse the registries. You can do that by typing: &ldquo;cd <reg db>&rdquo; (Example: cd HKLM:).</p><p>Windows also has a builtin tool named &ldquo;reg&rdquo; which can be used from the command line to add, remove, query, import, export, etc registry keys.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/dqckLsA.png></p><p>There is also available a GUI that can be used. You can search for &ldquo;Regedit&rdquo; or type it in the command line.</p><p>There is no point to remember the paths for some settings that are located in the registry editor.

To access it go to Tools > Active Directory Users and Computers.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/0o9mIl2.png></p><p>Before any other action let&rsquo;s enable Advanced Features which adds additional features when looking at an object properties. That is doable by going to View > Advanced Features.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/Mf5HQoV.png></p><p>By double-clicking on thm.lab we are presented with the Active Directory tree.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/DNq5OP0.png></p><p>Let&rsquo;s create an Organizational Unit (OU) where to store the users. To do that right-click on the domain name (thm.lab) and go to New > Organizational Unit. I named it LAB and clicked OK to create it.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/GTRcg13.png></p><p>Let&rsquo;s create two more OUs inside the newly created OU (it will look nested). In one OU we&rsquo;ll store users and in the second one, we&rsquo;ll store Groups. To create the OU&rsquo;s we can repeat the steps above (Right-click on LAB OU > New > Organizational Unit).</p><p>Time to create some users and groups! To do so right-click on the Users OU and go to New > User and fill in the information required.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/Tq7Un77.png></p><p>Click Next and set a password for the user.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/3sp6r1A.png></p><p>The reason I checked only &ldquo;Password never expires&rdquo; is because I do not want the password to expire after a period of time (the default period of time in AD is 42 days). In a production environment, you would probably check &ldquo;User must change password at next logon&rdquo; so the user can set a password he desires after you created his AD account.</p><p>Since the password can be set to expire after a period of time it would be a bad idea to check the &ldquo;User cannot change password&rdquo; because he won&rsquo;t be able to reset the password and you will have to manually intervene.</p><p>As for the last box &ldquo;Disable account&rdquo; it&rsquo;s obvious the action that will take place. It will disable the user account. You might want to disable a user account in case he has a leave (let&rsquo;s say 6 months leave) and you do not want him or any other colleague or malicious entity to use his account.</p><p>Click on Next and you will be shown the account information and click Finish to finish the account creation.</p><p>Note: The username that is going to be used by the user in order to authenticate is the one you set in the User Logon Name.</p><p>You&rsquo;ve successfully created your first AD user. Now, create two more users and name them as you wish.</p><p>We should have three users in the AD:</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/bT0lEUB.png></p><p>Let&rsquo;s move to the Groups OU. Right click on the OU > New > Group.</p><p>I named the group Admins and clicked OK to create it.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/psHMh2q.png></p><p>Then I created another group named RDP Access.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/35SeBm3.png></p><p>And finally using the same method create one more group named No RDP Access.</p><p>We should have the following groups in AD:</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/PuddIfX.png></p><p>To assign a user to a group you can do that in two ways:</p><ol><li><p>Right-clicking a user > Add to a group</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/DYvGtmj.png></p></li><li><p>Double-clicking a group > click on Members tab > Add</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/QKtJFk6.png></p></li></ol><p>Using the first method let&rsquo;s add Albert Einstein to the Admins group. A window will be prompted to search for an object in the AD. You can type in the Enter object name to select field the name of the group created (in my case Admins), click Check Names, and OK to add the user to the specified group.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/6iwqFZX.png></p><p>Proceed to add one of the created users to the RDP Access group and the other to the No RDP Access group.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that an object can be a member of another object (Ex: A group can be a member of another group).</p><p>We added Albert Einstein to a group named Admins. Let&rsquo;s add the Admins group to the Domain Admins group. To do that we can right-click on Admins group > Add to a group and search for Domain Admins and press OK.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/XAQ3KkR.png></p><p>As we&rsquo;ve done with Albert Einstein&rsquo;s account, add both RDP Access and No RDP Access groups to the Remote Desktop Users group</p><p>Note: Even though adding the No RDP Access group to the RDP Users group the No RDP Access group can be blocked using GPO. This will be done in the next task (Creating your first GPO).</p><hr><h2 id=task-07-creating-your-first-gpo>Task 07: Creating your first GPO<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#task-07-creating-your-first-gpo>#</a></h2><h3 id=what-is-group-policy-objects>What is Group Policy Objects?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-is-group-policy-objects>#</a></h3><p>A GPO or a Group Policy Object is a feature of Active Directory that adds additional controls to user accounts and computers.</p><p>Group Policy settings including local settings, site-wide settings, domain-level settings and settings applied to organizational units.</p><h3 id=creating-our-first-gpo>Creating our first GPO<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#creating-our-first-gpo>#</a></h3><p>To create a GPO we need to go to Tools > Group Policy Management inside the Server Manager.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/GE8h3A0.png></p><p>Right-click on &ldquo;Group Policy Objects&rdquo; and create a new object.

To edit the GPO right-click on it > Edit.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/XcOyxxM.png></p><p>For the purpose of this demo, we will set different permissions for the groups recently created.</p><p>First, let&rsquo;s let users authenticate using RDP. To do so, go to Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Users Right Assignment and double click on Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/hpLX7g6.png></p><p>Select Define these policy settings > Add user or group > Browse</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/OyH79LS.png></p><p>Search for Admins and RDP Access groups and click OK > OK to add them.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/OP8Fgqo.png></p><p>To block a user or a group to login using RDP we can do that by double-clicking Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services and adding No RDP Access group in there.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/mTZMi2E.png></p><p>We can close the editor and go back to our Group Policy Management console/tab/panel. In order to make the policy apply, we have to link the GPO to the root of the domain (thm.lab). To do that right-click on Domain Controllers OU > Link an existing GPO and select the GPO you created (Group GPO in my case) and press OK.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/LFn2U1g.png></p><p>To apply the GPO open a CMD as an administrator (right-click on it > Run as administrator) and type the following: gpupdate /force and wait for the policy to apply.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/rjTdPls.png></p><h3 id=testing-the-gpo>Testing the GPO<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#testing-the-gpo>#</a></h3><p>Let&rsquo;s try to RDP into the machine using each user and see the different level of access each has.</p><p>The first user I&rsquo;m going to login is Albert Einstein which has Domain Admin rights. The logon is successful. Open a CMD as admin and type &ldquo;whoami&rdquo;.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/OnBXV6m.png></p><p>As noticed we were able to start an elevated CMD.</p><p>Sign out and log in using the account added to RDP Access group (In my case Jim Carrey).</p><p>Try prompting an elevated CMD (Right-click on CMD > Run as administrator). You notice that UAC (User Account Control) asks for admin credentials. If you try entering the credentials (username and password) of the account you are currently logged in you will notice the CMD prompt will not pop out. This happens because you are a simple user on the machine, not an administrator.</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/y1WLs5G.png></p><p>Note: You can spawn the shell if you use an administrator credential (in my case Albert Einstein).</p><p>Lastly, try logging in with the account added to the No RDP Access. You will get the following error:</p><p><img alt=img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/cxpOsfc.png></p><p>This happens because even though the No RDP Access group has been added to the Remote Desktop Users group using the GPO earlier created he have blocked RDP access to the users that are in that group.</p><hr><script async src=https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js></script><p><ins class=adsbygoogle style=display:block;text-align:center data-ad-layout=in-article data-ad-format=fluid data-ad-client=ca-pub-3526678290068011 data-ad-slot=7160066188></ins></p><script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({})</script><script data-name=BMC-Widget data-cfasync=false src=https://cdnjs.buymeacoffee.com/1.0.0/widget.prod.min.js data-id=anir0y data-description="Support me on Buy me a coffee!" data-message data-color=#5F7FFF data-position=Right data-x_margin=18 data-y_margin=18></script></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://classroom.anir0y.in/tags/tryhackme/>Tryhackme</a></li><li><a href=https://classroom.anir0y.in/tags/rooms/>Rooms</a></li><li><a href=https://classroom.anir0y.in/tags/thm/>Thm</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://classroom.anir0y.in/post/tryhackme-wordpresscve202129447/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>TryHackMe Wordpress CVE-2021-29447</span>
