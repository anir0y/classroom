Once the website was moved from QA to Production, the team noticed that the website was getting hacked daily and wanted to know the exact reason. Bob consulted the blue team as well but has yet to be successful. Therefore, he finally enrolled in the Software Security pathway at THM to learn if he was doing something wrong.\nAnswer the following questions What type of encoding is used by the hackers to obfuscate the JavaScript file? To understand this I open the website and view the source code. I found a script tag with a link to a JavaScript file named “custom.min.js”. I open the file and see that the code is obfuscated using “hex” encoding. ref to the image:\nI used an online hex decoder to decode the code and found a flag in the decoded code. website: https://decoder.anir0y.in\nThe answer is: hex\nWhat is the flag value after deobfuscating the file? I ran the decoded code through dev console of my browser to get the data.\nThe answer is: DIRECTORY LISTING IS THE ONLY WAY\nLogging is an important aspect. What is the name of the file containing email dumps? Looking into the website source code I found a comment with a link to a dir name logs wehre I see the “email_dump.txt”.\n** The answer is: email_dump.txt**\nThe logs folder contains email logs and has a message for the software team lead. What is the name of the directory that Bob has created? Refer to the above image of email dump content. The message refer to “first phase of SSDLC” whic is “planning”.\nThe answer is: planning\nWhat is the key file for opening the directory that Bob has created for Mark? Referring to the email dump content image above, I found the key file name is “THM{100100111}”.\nWhat is the email address for ID 5 using the leaked API endpoint? To access this, I used the endpoint /planning to access the direcroty with the password “THM{100100111}”. Where I can see a endpoint referring to use the API as http://MACHINE IP/api/?customer_id=1\nbased on this I made a request to http://MACHINE IP/api/?customer_id=5 to get the email address for ID 5.\nThe answer is: john@traverse.com\nWhat is the ID for the user with admin privileges? Using the same API endpoint, I made a bruteforce request to http://MACHINE IP/api/?customer_id=FUZZ to get the ID for the user with admin privileges.\nseq 1 10 | while read i; do curl -s \"http://10.48.174.157/api/?customer_id=$i\" \\ | jq -r 'select(.data != null) | \"\\(.data.id)\\t\\(.data.name)\\t\\(.data.role)\"' done which is ID 3.\nWhat is the endpoint for logging in as the admin? Mention the last endpoint instead of the URL. For example, if the answer is URL is tryhackme.com/admin - Just write /admin. Referring to the API endpoint response for ID 3, I found the login endpoint is /realadmin\nThe answer is: /realadmin\nThe attacker uploaded a web shell and renamed a file used for managing the server. Can you find the name of the web shell that the attacker has uploaded? To find the web shell, I accessed the /realadmin endpoint and found a login page. I used the credentials mentioned on API response for ID 3 to login.\nI found a file manager where I can see the web shell file named “main.php”. which can execute system commands. I captured the image below.\nThen I use repeater tab in burpsuite to execute system commands using the web shell to list the files in the root directory.\n'\nThe answer is: thm_shell.php\nWhat is the name of the file renamed by the attacker for managing the web server? Referring to the above image of root directory listing, I found a file named “renamed_file_manager.php” which is used for managing the web server.\nThe answer is: renamed_file_manager.php\nCan you use the file manager to restore the original website by removing the “FINALLY HACKED” message? What is the flag value after restoring the main website? To get this, I use burp repeater tab to read the content of ‘renamed_file_manager.php’ file. and i got 2 set of credentials.\n$auth_users = array( 'admin' =\u003e '$2y$10$7I5BYtzKiWD7Gqip7ZoGvuN.nRb0EJAqJh8CZgRcHkNXZSQgTpFPu', //admin@123 'user' =\u003e '$2y$10$Fg6Dz8oH9fPoZ2jJan5tZuv6Z4Kp7avtQ9bDfrdRntXtPeiMAZyGO' //12345 ); The amdin password did not work but the user password worked. so I logged in with user: user and password: 12345. I can see the files but I cannot edit them. So I get back to the burp repeater tab and view the response of ls command to find the permission of the files. and I found that there is a line which says “Password for accessing original file manager: THM{10101}”\nI used this password to login to the original file manager and edit the index.php file to remove the “FINALLY HACKED” message. And I can see the flag in the main website.\n","wordCount":"830","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://classroom.anir0y.in/img/thm.gif","datePublished":"2026-01-04T20:58:51+05:30","dateModified":"2026-01-04T20:58:51+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Animesh Roy"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://classroom.anir0y.in/post/traverse/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Classroom","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://classroom.anir0y.in/img/avatar.jpeg"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://classroom.anir0y.in/ accesskey=h title="Classroom (Alt + H)"><img src=https://classroom.anir0y.in/img/avatar.jpeg alt aria-label=logo height=35>Classroom</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

So I get back to the burp repeater tab and view the response of <code>ls</code> command to find the permission of the files. and I found that there is a line which says &ldquo;Password for accessing original file manager: THM{10101}&rdquo;</p><p><img alt="file permission" loading=lazy src=/img/traverse/11.png></p><p>I used this password to login to the original file manager and edit the index.php file to remove the &ldquo;FINALLY HACKED&rdquo; message.
And I can see the flag in the main website.</p><p><img alt=edit loading=lazy src=/img/traverse/12.png></p><p><img alt=flag loading=lazy src=/img/traverse/13.png></p><hr><script async src=https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js></script><p><ins class=adsbygoogle style=display:block;text-align:center data-ad-layout=in-article data-ad-format=fluid data-ad-client=ca-pub-3526678290068011 data-ad-slot=7160066188></ins></p><script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({})</script><script data-name=BMC-Widget data-cfasync=false src=https://cdnjs.buymeacoffee.com/1.0.0/widget.prod.min.js data-id=anir0y data-description="Support me on Buy me a coffee!" data-message data-color=#5F7FFF data-position=Right data-x_margin=18 data-y_margin=18></script></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://classroom.anir0y.in/tags/tryhackme/>Tryhackme</a></li><li><a href=https://classroom.anir0y.in/tags/rooms/>Rooms</a></li><li><a href=https://classroom.anir0y.in/tags/thm/>Thm</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://classroom.anir0y.in/post/blog-dissecting-rto-echallan-banking-trojan/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Dissecting a Two-Stage Indian Banking Trojan: From Fake eChallan to Full Device Compromise</span>
