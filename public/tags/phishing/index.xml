&lt;p&gt;Email phishing is the most common type of phishing attack. It involves sending fraudulent emails that appear to be from reputable sources, such as banks, social media platforms, or government agencies. The emails usually contain a link to a fake website that is designed to steal the victim&amp;rsquo;s login credentials or personal information. The website may look similar to the legitimate one, but it is actually a phishing site created by cybercriminals to steal data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
