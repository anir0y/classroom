      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;osi-model-explained&#34;&gt;OSI Model Explained&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;OSI Model&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/r4SjjLc.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;packet-details&#34;&gt;Packet Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can double click on a packet in capture to open its details. Packets consist of 5 to 7 layers based on the OSI model. We will go over all of them in an HTTP packet from a sample capture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/7t17lRS.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking above we can see 7 distinct layers to the packet: frame/packet, source [MAC], source [IP], protocol, protocol errors, application protocol, and application data. Below we will go over the layers in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;osi-model-overview&#34;&gt;OSI Model OverView&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a standardised model which we use to demonstrate the theory behind computer networking. In practice, it&amp;rsquo;s actually the more compact TCP/IP model that real-world networking is based off; however the OSI model, in many ways, is easier to get an initial understanding from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OSI model consists of seven layers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Layers&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Application&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;presentation&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;session&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;transport&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Network&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Data Link&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Physical&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many mnemonics floating around to help you learn the layers of the OSI model &amp;ndash; search around until you find one that you like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-to-use-gpg-to-encrypt-and-sign-messages&#34;&gt;How To Use GPG to Encrypt and Sign Messages&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPG, or GNU Privacy Guard, is a public key cryptography implementation. This allows for the secure transmission of information between parties and can be used to verify that the origin of a message is genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this guide, we will discuss how GPG works and how to implement it. We will be using an Ubuntu 16.04 server for this demonstration, but will include instructions for other distributions as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;writing-meterpreter-scripts&#34;&gt;WRITING METERPRETER SCRIPTS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things you need to keep in mind when creating a new Meterpreter script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all versions of Windows are the same&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some versions of Windows have security countermeasures for some of the commands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all command line tools are in all versions of Windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the command line tools switches vary depending on the version of Windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our purposes, we are going to create a stand alone binary that will be run on the target system that will create a reverse Meterpreter shell back to us. This will rule out any problems with an exploit as we work through our script development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;multihandler-listener&#34;&gt;Multihandler Listener&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get multiple session on a single multi/handler, you need to set the ExitOnSession option to false and run the exploit -j instead of just the exploit. For example, for meterpreter/reverse_tcp payload,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) are both security services that focus on identifying vulnerabilities in the network, server and system infrastructure. Both the services serves a different purpose and are carried out to achieve different but complimentary goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability Assessment focuses on internal organizational security, while Penetration Testing focuses on external real-world risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-vulnerability-assessment-va&#34;&gt;What is Vulnerability Assessment (VA)?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Vulnerability Assessment is a rapid automated review of network devices, servers and systems to identify key vulnerabilities and configuration issues that an attacker may be able to take advantage off. Its generally conducted within the network on internal devices and due to its low footprint can be carried out as often as every day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;metasploit-cheat-sheet&#34;&gt;Metasploit Cheat Sheet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metasploit Project is a computer security project that provides information on vulnerabilities, helping in the development of penetration tests and IDS signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metasploit is a popular tool used by pentest experts. I have prepared a document for you to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;metasploit-&#34;&gt;Metasploit :&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&#34;search-for-module&#34;&gt;Search for module:&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;msf &amp;gt; search [regex]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h6 id=&#34;specify-and-exploit-to-use&#34;&gt;Specify and exploit to use:&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;msf &amp;gt; use exploit/[ExploitPath]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h6 id=&#34;specify-a-payload-to-use&#34;&gt;Specify a Payload to use:&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;msf &amp;gt; set PAYLOAD [PayloadPath]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h6 id=&#34;show-options-for-the-current-modules&#34;&gt;Show options for the current modules:&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;msf &amp;gt; show options
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h6 id=&#34;set-options&#34;&gt;Set options:&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;msf &amp;gt; set [Option] [Value]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h6 id=&#34;start-exploit&#34;&gt;Start exploit:&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;msf &amp;gt; exploit 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h5 id=&#34;useful-auxiliary-modules&#34;&gt;Useful Auxiliary Modules&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&#34;port-scanner&#34;&gt;Port Scanner:&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;msf &amp;gt; use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
msf &amp;gt; set RHOSTS 10.10.10.0/24
msf &amp;gt; run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h6 id=&#34;dns-enumeration&#34;&gt;DNS Enumeration:&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;msf &amp;gt; use auxiliary/gather/dns_enum
msf &amp;gt; set DOMAIN target.tgt
msf &amp;gt; run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h6 id=&#34;ftp-server&#34;&gt;FTP Server:&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;msf &amp;gt; use auxiliary/server/ftp
msf &amp;gt; set FTPROOT /tmp/ftproot
msf &amp;gt; run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h6 id=&#34;proxy-server&#34;&gt;Proxy Server:&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;msf &amp;gt; use auxiliary/server/socks4
msf &amp;gt; run 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;msfvenom-&#34;&gt;msfvenom :&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The msfvenom tool can be used to generate Metasploit payloads (such as Meterpreter) as standalone files and optionally encode
them. This tool replaces the former msfpayload and msfencode tools. Run with ‘&amp;rsquo;-l payloads’ to get a list of payloads.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;prerequisites&#34;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this is based on Basics of cyber security, so basic knowledge of computer and programming language (PHP,MySQL,Python) is a bonus. if you don’t know anything about these, you can learn the basic for free &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sololearn.com/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;system-requirements&#34;&gt;System requirements&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A laptop/Desktop with least 2MBPS internet connection. 50 GB of disk space 4 GB of RAM (min) any processor above i3 3rd generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;os-recommendation&#34;&gt;OS recommendation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this is designed for entry level training. any OS is okay, all of our work/practical will be done on a VM running Linux OS. doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what OS you have installed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
