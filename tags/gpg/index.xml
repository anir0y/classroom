&lt;p>When you import a GPG key, you are trusting that the key belongs to the person or organization who claims to own it. There are a few ways to trust imported GPG keys:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Web of trust: The web of trust is a decentralized system for verifying GPG keys. When you import a key, you can choose to trust it based on the trust of other people in the web of trust.
Keyserver: A keyserver is a server that stores GPG keys. When you import a key, you can choose to trust it based on the trust of the keyserver.
Manually: You can also manually trust a GPG key by adding it to your keyring with the gpg &amp;ndash;edit-key command.
Once you have trusted an imported GPG key, you can use it to encrypt and sign data.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://classroom.anir0y.in/img/gpg.png"/><link>https://classroom.anir0y.in/post/blog-how-to-trust-imported-gpg-keys/</link></item></channel></rss>
